# Sunlu PLA+: A Deep Dive into This Popular 3D Printing Filament

Sunlu PLA+ is a widely recognized filament in the 3D printing community, often praised for its improved strength and ease of use compared to standard PLA. But does it live up to the hype? Let's take a comprehensive look.

## What is Sunlu PLA+?

PLA+ (Polylactic Acid Plus) is a modified version of PLA, a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane. The "+" indicates that it has been engineered to have enhanced properties, typically focusing on increased toughness, improved layer adhesion, and a slightly higher heat resistance than basic PLA. Sunlu's offering is a popular choice for hobbyists and professionals alike.

## Detailed Specifications

*   **Material:** Modified Polylactic Acid (PLA+)
*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm (typically with a tolerance of ±0.03mm)
*   **Spool Weight:** 1kg (2.2 lbs)
*   **Printing Temperature:** 200-230°C (392-446°F) - *This is a general range; optimal temperature may vary based on your printer and environment.*
*   **Bed Temperature:** 60-70°C (140-158°F) - *Heated bed is recommended but not always required. Adhesion can be improved with glue stick or hairspray on a non-heated bed.*
*   **Tensile Strength:** Varies by manufacturer, but generally higher than standard PLA. Check Sunlu's official documentation for specific numbers.
*   **Elongation at Break:** Higher than standard PLA, indicating greater flexibility before breaking.
*   **Density:** Approximately 1.25 g/cm³
*   **Glass Transition Temperature:** Around 60°C (140°F)
*   **Spool Dimensions:** (Generally standard dimensions, but check the specific product listing on Sunlu's site or your vendor)
*   **Available Colors:** Sunlu offers a very wide range of colors in PLA+, including basic colors, silks, mattes, glow-in-the-dark, and more.

## Usage Tips for Optimal Printing with Sunlu PLA+

Here are some key tips to ensure you get the best results with Sunlu PLA+:

*   **Temperature Tuning:**  Start within the recommended temperature range (200-230°C) and print a temperature tower. This will help you identify the ideal temperature for your specific printer and the PLA+ color you're using. Look for good layer adhesion, minimal stringing, and a smooth surface finish.

*   **Bed Adhesion is Key:** While PLA+ is generally good with bed adhesion, proper bed leveling is crucial.  A clean print surface is also essential.  Wiping down your bed with isopropyl alcohol before printing helps. If you still experience issues, try using a glue stick, hairspray, or painter's tape on the bed.

*   **Cooling Fan Settings:**  PLA+ benefits from cooling.  Start with a 100% fan speed after the first few layers. This helps prevent warping and improves overhang performance.

*   **Print Speed:** A moderate print speed is recommended.  Speeds between 40-60 mm/s are a good starting point. Higher speeds might require higher temperatures.

*   **Retraction Settings:**  Fine-tune your retraction settings to minimize stringing.  Increasing retraction distance or speed can help.

*   **Storage:** PLA+ is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. This can lead to printing issues like bubbling, stringing, and poor layer adhesion. Store your filament in an airtight container with desiccant when not in use.  If you suspect your filament has absorbed moisture, dry it using a filament dryer or by placing it in an oven at a low temperature (around 45-50°C) for several hours.

*   **First Layer Calibration:** Ensuring your first layer is properly calibrated is essential for good adhesion and a successful print. Take your time and adjust your Z offset until the first layer is slightly squished onto the bed.

*   **Avoid Drafts:** PLA+ is sensitive to drafts, especially during the early stages of printing.  Try to print in a draft-free environment.

## Comprehensive Evaluation of Sunlu PLA+ (Out of 10)

Here's a breakdown of Sunlu PLA+'s performance based on key characteristics:

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 - Generally excellent, produces smooth surfaces and good detail. Minor imperfections can occur if settings are not properly tuned.
*   **Toughness:** 9/10 - Significantly stronger than standard PLA, making it suitable for functional parts.
*   **Flexibility:** 5/10 - PLA+ is not particularly flexible compared to filaments like TPU. It has some flexibility, but it's more brittle than flexible filaments.
*   **Warping:** 7/10 - Less prone to warping than standard PLA, but can still occur with large prints or insufficient bed adhesion.
*   **Adhesion:** 8/10 - Excellent adhesion to heated beds, especially with proper preparation (cleaning, glue stick).
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10 - While PLA in general is moisture-sensitive, PLA+ is still more than other materials.
*   **Color Range:** 10/10 - Sunlu offers a vast and diverse color palette for their PLA+ filament, including specialty colors and finishes.
*   **Temperature Range:** 7/10 - The recommended temperature range is relatively narrow, requiring some fine-tuning for optimal results.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9/10 - Produces minimal odor and fumes during printing, similar to standard PLA.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8/10 - Generally well-wound, minimizing the risk of tangles during printing.

**Average Score:** (8+9+5+7+8+6+10+7+9+8) / 10 = **7.7/10**
