# Diving Deep into the 3D Systems CubePro: A Detailed Look

The 3D Systems CubePro was a desktop 3D printer aimed at professionals, designers, and serious hobbyists. While no longer in production, it remains a fixture in some workshops and a topic of discussion for those interested in the evolution of desktop 3D printing. This article provides a detailed look at its specifications, offers usage tips for those still operating one, and concludes with a comprehensive evaluation based on key performance indicators.

## Specifications

Let's begin by outlining the core specifications of the CubePro:

*   **Technology:** Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
*   **Build Volume:** 275 x 265 x 230 mm (10.8 x 10.4 x 9.1 inches)
*   **Layer Resolution:** 70 microns (0.07 mm)
*   **Material Compatibility:** ABS, PLA, Infinity Rinse-Away Support Material
*   **Extruder:** Triple-Jet Printing System (up to three materials simultaneously)
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi, USB
*   **Software:** Cubify Invent (often requires modifications for modern operating systems)
*   **Physical Dimensions:** 578 x 578 x 516 mm (22.8 x 22.8 x 20.3 inches)
*   **Weight:** 30 kg (66 lbs)

## Usage Tips and Considerations

If you are a current CubePro user, these tips can help optimize your experience:

*   **Material Selection:** The CubePro was designed primarily for ABS and PLA. Experimenting with other materials might be possible but requires significant tweaking of temperature and print settings.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** Ensuring proper bed adhesion is crucial. A clean, level build platform is the first step. Applying a thin layer of glue stick or painter's tape can further improve adhesion, especially for ABS.
*   **Temperature Control:** ABS prints require a heated build plate and, ideally, a controlled environment to prevent warping. PLA is more forgiving but still benefits from a consistent temperature.
*   **Software Challenges:** The original Cubify Invent software may not be compatible with the latest operating systems. Consider exploring alternative slicing software like Cura or Simplify3D. Be prepared to create custom profiles.
*   **Maintenance:** Regular maintenance is essential for optimal performance. This includes cleaning the nozzles, lubricating moving parts, and ensuring proper belt tension.
*   **Support Material:** The Infinity Rinse-Away support material can be challenging to work with. Experiment with print settings to minimize support structure and optimize its removal process. Proper drying of the support materials is key, otherwise it will expand as it absorbs moisture from the air and bind.

## CubePro Evaluation: A Detailed Breakdown

Here's a breakdown of the CubePro's performance based on key criteria, scored out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 7/10. The CubePro offered good, but not exceptional, print quality. Layer resolution could be finer.
*   **Build Volume:** 8/10. The build volume was generous, allowing for larger prints.
*   **Printing Speed:** 6/10. Printing speed was moderate, slower compared to some more modern printers.
*   **Material Compatibility:** 5/10. Limited primarily to ABS and PLA.
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 6/10. Prone to adhesion issues; leveling could be tricky. Requires vigilance.
*   **Reliability:** 6/10. Could be temperamental, requiring consistent maintenance and calibration.
*   **Ease of Use:** 5/10. Not particularly user-friendly, especially with the software limitations.
*   **Firmware and Software:** 4/10. Outdated software a significant drawback.
*   **Connectivity Options:** 7/10. Wi-Fi and USB provide adequate connectivity.
*   **Build Quality & Durability:** 7/10. Sturdy construction, but some components prone to wear.
*   **Noise Level:** 6/10. Moderately noisy during operation.
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** 7/10. Regular maintenance is crucial.
*   **Customer Support:** 3/10. Official support is practically non-existent now.
*   **Upgradeability:** 4/10. Limited upgrade options.
*   **Price to Performance Ratio:** 5/10. At its original price, it was not a strong value proposition. Given its age and limitations, purchasing a used CubePro today requires careful consideration.

**Average Score: 5.73/10**

## Conclusion

The 3D Systems CubePro was a promising printer at its time, offering a large build volume and multi-material capabilities. However, its limitations in material compatibility, software, and reliability, along with the lack of current support, make it a challenging machine to use effectively today. While it's not recommended for beginners, experienced users willing to invest the time in troubleshooting and customization might still find value in it.
