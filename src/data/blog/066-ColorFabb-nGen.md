# ColorFabb nGen: A Deep Dive into This Versatile 3D Printing Filament

ColorFabb nGen has carved out a significant niche for itself in the 3D printing world. Marketed as a general-purpose filament, it aims to bridge the gap between ease of printing and robust mechanical properties. Let's explore what makes nGen tick and why it might be the right choice for your next project.

## What is ColorFabb nGen?

nGen is a filament developed by ColorFabb, based on Eastman Amphora™ AM3300 3D polymer. It's designed to be user-friendly, offering good printability similar to PLA but with enhanced strength, temperature resistance, and functionality. This makes it suitable for a broad range of applications, from prototyping to functional parts.

## Detailed Specifications:

*   **Material:** Eastman Amphora™ AM3300
*   **Diameter:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm (make sure to verify with your supplier).
*   **Density:** 1.19 g/cm³
*   **Glass Transition Temperature:** 85°C
*   **Recommended Print Temperature:** 220-240°C (Start at 230°C)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 75-85°C (Often works well with 70°C)
*   **Print Speed:** 40-70 mm/s (Adjust based on your printer's capabilities and desired finish)
*   **Cooling Fan:** Generally recommended, but adjust speed based on bridging needs.
*   **Tensile Strength:** 42 MPa
*   **Elongation at Break:** 15%

## Usage Tips for Optimal Results:

*   **Bed Adhesion:** NGen usually adheres well to a heated glass bed coated with a thin layer of glue stick or hairspray. PEI beds also work excellently. Using a brim can further enhance adhesion, especially for large prints.
*   **Temperature Tuning:** Start with the recommended temperature ranges but fine-tune based on your specific printer and ambient conditions. If you see stringing, try lowering the temperature by 5°C increments.
*   **Cooling:** While cooling is recommended, excessive cooling can lead to layer adhesion issues. Experiment with fan speed to find the sweet spot. Turn the fan off completely for the first layer, if possible, to enhance bed adhesion.
*   **Print Speed:** For intricate details, slow down the print speed. For larger, less detailed objects, you can increase the speed.
*   **Enclosure:** While not strictly required, using an enclosure can improve dimensional accuracy and reduce the risk of warping, especially for larger prints.
*   **Storage:** Like most filaments, nGen is hygroscopic. Store it in an airtight container with desiccant to prevent moisture absorption.

## Key Advantages of ColorFabb nGen:

*   **Good Mechanical Properties:** Offers a better balance of strength and toughness compared to PLA.
*   **Temperature Resistance:** Higher glass transition temperature than PLA, making it suitable for parts that might experience elevated temperatures.
*   **Printability:** Easier to print than many engineering filaments, making it a good option for both beginners and experienced users.
*   **Surface Finish:** Often produces parts with a smooth and glossy finish.
*   **Relatively Low Odor:** Compared to ABS, nGen produces minimal odor during printing.
*   **Wide Color Range:** ColorFabb offers a wide variety of colors in the nGen lineup.

## Evaluation of ColorFabb nGen (Out of 10):

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 (Capable of producing detailed prints with a good surface finish)
*   **Toughness:** 7/10 (Stronger than PLA, but not as tough as some engineering filaments)
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 (Not particularly flexible; more rigid)
*   **Warping:** 6/10 (Less prone to warping than ABS, but can still occur with large prints)
*   **Adhesion:** 8/10 (Excellent adhesion to properly prepared print surfaces)
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 7/10 (Hygroscopic; requires proper storage)
*   **Color Range:** 9/10 (Excellent selection of colors)
*   **Temperature Range:** 7/10 (Acceptable temperature range for a wide variety of printers)
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9/10 (Very low odor during printing)
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8/10 (Typically well-wound, minimizing tangles)

**Average Score: 7.2/10**

## Conclusion:

ColorFabb nGen is a solid choice for users looking for a versatile filament that combines ease of printing with enhanced mechanical properties and temperature resistance. Its wide color range and relatively low odor make it a pleasant material to work with. While it's not the toughest or most flexible filament available, it strikes a good balance, making it suitable for a broad range of 3D printing projects. By following the usage tips outlined above, you can maximize your chances of success with nGen and create high-quality, functional parts.
