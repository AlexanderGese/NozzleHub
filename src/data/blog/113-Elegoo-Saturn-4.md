*   **Power Requirements:** 100-240V, 50/60Hz
*   **Dimensions:** 305.7x273x457.5 mm
*   **Weight:** 11kg

**Unboxing and Setup**

The Elegoo Saturn 4 comes well-packaged and requires minimal assembly. Typically, you'll need to:

1.  Remove all packaging materials.
2.  Level the build plate (a crucial step for successful prints).
3.  Install the resin vat.
4.  Connect the power cord and turn on the printer.

The included manual provides detailed instructions and diagrams to guide you through the setup process. Don't skip the leveling procedure – proper leveling is essential for good bed adhesion.

**Usage Tips and Best Practices**

*   **Leveling is Key:** Double-check the build plate leveling before each printing session, especially after moving the printer or changing the resin vat.
*   **Resin Handling:** Always wear gloves and eye protection when handling resin. Work in a well-ventilated area. Dispose of used resin properly according to local regulations.
*   **Resin Settings:** Experiment with resin settings (exposure time, lift speed, etc.) to find the optimal parameters for your specific resin. The manufacturer's recommendations are a good starting point, but fine-tuning is often necessary.
*   **Supports:** Use appropriate supports for your models. Adequate supports prevent print failures due to gravity and suction forces. Consider the orientation of your model to minimize support usage.
*   **Hollowing:** Hollowing out large models can save a significant amount of resin. Remember to include drain holes to allow resin to escape during the printing process.
*   **Cleaning:** Clean the build plate and resin vat thoroughly after each print. Use isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove any remaining resin. A soft brush or scraper can help dislodge stubborn residue.
*   **Temperature:** Maintain a stable temperature in your printing environment. Fluctuations in temperature can affect resin viscosity and print quality. A range of 20-25°C (68-77°F) is generally recommended.
*   **Storage:** Store resin in a cool, dark place in a sealed container. Exposure to light and air can cause the resin to cure prematurely.
*   **ACF Release Film:** The ACF release film is much faster and needs less exposuretime.

**Key Features and Benefits**

*   **High Resolution:** The 12K resolution LCD screen delivers incredibly detailed prints with smooth surfaces.
*   **Large Build Volume:** The generous build volume allows you to print larger models or multiple smaller objects in a single batch.
*   **Fast Printing Speed:** High-speed printing enables faster prototyping and production times, when coupled with suitable resins.
*   **Dual Linear Rails:** The dual linear rail Z-axis provides stability and accuracy, resulting in consistent print quality.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** The 4-inch touchscreen interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
*   **Compatibility with Various Resins:** The Saturn 4 supports a wide range of 405nm UV resins, giving you flexibility in material selection.
*   **ACF release film:** Release film for high speed resin.
*   **Automatic Resin Fill:** You no longer have to worry about refilling resin
**Troubleshooting Common Issues**

*   **Print Not Sticking to the Build Plate:**
    *   Ensure the build plate is properly leveled.
    *   Increase the initial layer exposure time.
    *   Clean the build plate thoroughly with IPA.
    *   Check the resin's expiration date.
*   **Print Delamination:**
    *   Increase the layer exposure time.
    *   Reduce the lift speed.
    *   Ensure the resin is properly mixed.
    *   Check the temperature of the printing environment.
*   **Support Failures:**
    *   Increase the support density.
    *   Increase the support thickness.
    *   Adjust the support angle.
    *   Ensure the supports are properly connected to the model.
*   **Clouding:**
    *   Over exposure could be happening reduce the exposure time.
