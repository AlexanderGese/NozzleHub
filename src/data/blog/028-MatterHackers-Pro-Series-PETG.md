## MatterHackers Pro Series PETG: A Deep Dive

PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-modified) is rapidly becoming a staple in the 3D printing world, prized for its balance of strength, ease of use, and impact resistance. The MatterHackers Pro Series PETG aims to be a premium version of this already popular filament. Let's take a closer look at what makes it stand out.

**What is MatterHackers Pro Series PETG?**

MatterHackers Pro Series PETG is a filament designed for users seeking reliable, high-performance prints. It’s formulated to offer improved strength and dimensional accuracy compared to standard PETG filaments. It's aimed at both hobbyists looking for better results and professionals needing robust prototypes and end-use parts.

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Material:** PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-modified)
*   **Diameter:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm (check specific product listings)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** +/- 0.05mm (A tight tolerance ensures consistent extrusion)
*   **Roundness:** +/- 0.03mm
*   **Glass Transition Temperature:** ~80°C (This indicates its thermal resistance)
*   **Recommended Print Temperature:** 230-250°C (Specific to printer and part geometry)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 70-80°C (A heated bed is generally required)
*   **Density:** 1.27 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** (Varies with print parameters, generally in the range of 40-50 MPa) – *Consult MatterHackers for exact testing data.*
*   **Elongation at Break:** (Varies with print parameters, generally in the range of 5-10%) – *Consult MatterHackers for exact testing data.*

**Why Choose PETG?**

PETG offers a compelling alternative to both PLA and ABS, bridging the gap between ease of use and functional strength. Here’s a quick overview of its advantages:

*   **Good Strength and Durability:** PETG offers significantly improved strength and impact resistance compared to PLA.
*   **Heat Resistance:** Higher temperature resistance than PLA makes it suitable for parts that might be exposed to moderate heat.
*   **Low Warping:** Less prone to warping compared to ABS, making it easier to print large parts.
*   **Moisture Resistance:** PETG is less hygroscopic than PLA and ABS, meaning it absorbs less moisture from the air, which contributes to more consistent printing.
*   **Food Safe:** PETG is considered food-safe when printed with appropriate settings and using a food-safe nozzle. *Always verify the specific certification for your application.*

**Usage Tips for Optimal Results:**

Getting the most out of MatterHackers Pro Series PETG requires a bit of tuning, but the results are well worth the effort. Here are some key tips:

*   **Temperature Tuning:** Start with the recommended print temperature (230-250°C) and bed temperature (70-80°C) and adjust based on your printer. If you see stringing, lower the temperature slightly. If layers aren't bonding well, increase the temperature.
*   **Print Speed:** PETG generally prints best at moderate speeds. Start around 40-60 mm/s and adjust as needed. Too fast, and you may experience under-extrusion or weak layer adhesion.
*   **Cooling Fan:** Use a moderate amount of cooling. Too much cooling can lead to layer adhesion problems, while too little can cause stringing and warping. Experiment to find the sweet spot for your printer and part geometry.
*   **Retraction Settings:** PETG is prone to stringing, so dialing in your retraction settings is crucial. Increase retraction distance and speed to minimize stringing.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** Clean your build plate thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol. A thin layer of glue stick or hairspray can improve adhesion, especially for large parts. Consider using a brim or raft for added security.
*   **Drying Filament:** While PETG is less hygroscopic than some other filaments, it can still absorb moisture over time, especially in humid environments. If you experience popping or hissing during printing, dry your filament in a filament dryer or oven (at a low temperature) before use.
*   **Enclosure (Optional):** While not strictly necessary, an enclosure can help stabilize the temperature and reduce warping, particularly for large parts.
*   **Nozzle Recommendation:** A steel nozzle is recommended because some filaments can damage other nozzles but use whatever works best for your desired outcome.

**Judgement Scores (out of 10):**

*   **Print Quality:** 9
*   **Toughness:** 8
*   **Flexibility:** 5
*   **Warping:** 7
*   **Adhesion:** 8
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 7
*   **Color Range:** 8
*   **Temperature Range:** 8
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 7
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 9
