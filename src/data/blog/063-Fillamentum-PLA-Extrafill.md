## Fillamentum PLA Extrafill: A Deep Dive into This Popular Filament

Fillamentum PLA Extrafill has become a staple in the 3D printing community, known for its consistent quality, wide color range, and ease of use. This article provides a comprehensive overview of this popular filament, covering its specifications, best practices for printing, and a detailed evaluation of its key attributes.

**What is Fillamentum PLA Extrafill?**

Fillamentum PLA Extrafill is a premium polylactic acid (PLA) filament manufactured by Fillamentum, a Czech Republic-based company renowned for its commitment to quality and precision. PLA is a bioplastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane, making it a more environmentally friendly option compared to petroleum-based filaments like ABS. Extrafill refers to Fillamentum's precise manufacturing process, resulting in consistent diameter and roundness throughout the spool.

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Material:** Polylactic Acid (PLA)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** ± 0.05 mm
*   **Roundness:** ± 0.01 mm
*   **Recommended Nozzle Temperature:** 190-220°C (374-428°F)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 50-60°C (122-140°F)
*   **Spool Weight:** Typically 750g or 2.5kg
*   **Density:** 1.24 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** 50 MPa
*   **Elongation at Break:** 7%
*   **Available Diameters:** 1.75 mm, 2.85 mm
*   **Wide Range of Colors:** Fillamentum offers a vast selection of colors, including solid, metallic, and translucent options.

**Best Practices for Printing with Fillamentum PLA Extrafill:**

To achieve optimal results with Fillamentum PLA Extrafill, consider these tips:

1.  **Temperature Settings:** Start with a nozzle temperature of 210°C and a bed temperature of 60°C. Fine-tune these settings based on your specific printer and environmental conditions. A temperature tower test is highly recommended to dial in the optimal nozzle temperature for your chosen color.
2.  **Bed Adhesion:** A clean and level print bed is crucial for successful PLA printing. Use a suitable bed adhesive like blue painter's tape, glue stick, or PEI sheet. Ensure your first layer is properly calibrated for optimal adhesion.
3.  **Cooling Fan:** PLA benefits from active cooling. Use your printer's cooling fan at 100% after the first few layers to prevent warping and improve overhang performance.
4.  **Print Speed:** A moderate print speed of 40-60 mm/s is recommended for PLA Extrafill. Faster speeds may require higher nozzle temperatures and increased cooling.
5.  **Storage:** PLA is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store your filament in a sealed container with desiccant to prevent moisture absorption, which can lead to stringing and poor print quality.
6.  **Retraction:** Fine-tune your retraction settings to minimize stringing. Experiment with retraction distance and speed to find the optimal settings for your printer.

**Fillamentum PLA Extrafill Evaluation:**

Here's a detailed breakdown of Fillamentum PLA Extrafill's performance in key areas, rated out of 10:

*   **Print Quality (9/10):** Excellent surface finish, sharp details, and minimal imperfections when printed with proper settings.
*   **Toughness (6/10):** PLA is generally not as tough as other materials like ABS or PETG. It's suitable for decorative and functional parts that don't require high impact resistance.
*   **Flexibility (3/10):** PLA is a relatively rigid material with limited flexibility.
*   **Warping (8/10):** PLA exhibits minimal warping, especially when printed with a heated bed and proper cooling.
*   **Adhesion (9/10):** Excellent bed adhesion to various surfaces when using appropriate bed preparation techniques.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity (6/10):** PLA is moderately sensitive to moisture. Proper storage is essential to prevent printing issues.
*   **Color Range (10/10):** Fillamentum offers an extensive and vibrant color range, catering to diverse printing needs and aesthetic preferences.
*   **Temperature Range (8/10):** The recommended temperature range is relatively narrow, but it's easy to dial in the optimal settings.
*   **Odor & Fumes (9/10):** PLA produces a minimal and generally pleasant odor during printing. It's considered a safer option compared to ABS.
*   **Spool Winding Quality (10/10):** Fillamentum's spool winding is consistently excellent, preventing tangles and ensuring smooth filament feeding.

**Overall Average Score: 7.8/10**

**Conclusion:**

Fillamentum PLA Extrafill is a high-quality filament that delivers excellent print results, a wide color range, and ease of use. Its minimal warping and good adhesion make it a great choice for both beginners and experienced 3D printing enthusiasts. While PLA is not the toughest or most flexible material, it's a versatile option for a wide range of applications, especially when print quality and aesthetics are paramount. By following the recommended printing practices and storing the filament properly, you can achieve consistently outstanding results with Fillamentum PLA Extrafill.
