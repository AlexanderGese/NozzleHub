# Fillamentum CPE HG100: A Deep Dive into High-Performance 3D Printing

Fillamentum is well-regarded for producing high-quality filaments, and their CPE HG100 (Chemical PolyEthylene Terephthalate Glycol High Gloss) stands out as a particularly versatile and robust option. This article delves into the specifics of CPE HG100, covering its properties, best practices for printing, and how it stacks up against other filaments within the Fillamentum ecosystem.

## What is CPE HG100?

CPE HG100 is a modified PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) filament, engineered for improved performance in 3D printing. The addition of Glycol (the "G" in PETG) and Fillamentum's proprietary formulation provide enhanced toughness, chemical resistance, and a visually appealing, high-gloss finish. This makes it a suitable material for a wide range of applications, from functional prototypes to end-use parts.

## Detailed Specifications:

*   **Material:** CPE (Chemical PolyEthylene) HG100
*   **Diameter:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm (verify specific product listing)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** Typically ± 0.05mm
*   **Roundness Tolerance:** Typically ± 0.02mm
*   **Printing Temperature:** 240-260°C (464-500°F)
*   **Bed Temperature:** 70-90°C (158-194°F)
*   **Density:** 1.27 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** ~50 MPa (varies with printing parameters)
*   **Elongation at Break:** ~50% (varies with printing parameters)
*   **Impact Strength (Izod):** ~16 kJ/m² (varies with printing parameters)
*   **Recommended Printing Speed:** 40-80 mm/s (adjust as needed)
*   **Spool Sizes:** Typically available in 750g and 2.5kg spools

## Key Features and Benefits:

*   **High Gloss Finish:** Creates visually appealing prints with a smooth, shiny surface.
*   **Chemical Resistance:** Resistant to a variety of chemicals, including oils, greases, and some solvents, making it suitable for industrial applications.
*   **Toughness and Durability:** Offers improved impact resistance and overall durability compared to standard PETG.
*   **Low Odor:** Produces minimal odor during printing, making it more pleasant to work with.
*   **Food Contact Approved:** Some colors/versions may be food contact approved. *Always verify specific product certifications before using for food-related applications.*

## Usage Tips for Optimal Printing:

*   **Bed Adhesion:** CPE HG100 generally adheres well to a variety of bed surfaces, including glass, PEI, and BuildTak. Using a bed adhesive like glue stick or hairspray can further enhance adhesion, especially for larger prints.
*   **Print Temperature:** Start with a nozzle temperature around 250°C and adjust as needed. If you see stringing, slightly reduce the temperature. If layers aren't bonding well, increase the temperature.
*   **Bed Temperature:** A heated bed is crucial. Aim for a temperature between 70-90°C.
*   **Cooling Fan:** Use a moderate cooling fan (20-50%) to help prevent warping and improve print quality, especially for overhangs. Adjust cooling based on the complexity of the model.
*   **Print Speed:** Start with a moderate print speed of 50mm/s and adjust based on your printer and the complexity of the model. Reducing speed can improve layer adhesion and reduce warping.
*   **Retraction Settings:** Fine-tune retraction settings to minimize stringing. A retraction distance of 4-7mm and a retraction speed of 40-60mm/s is a good starting point.
*   **Enclosure:** While not strictly necessary, an enclosure can help maintain a consistent temperature around the print, further reducing the risk of warping, especially for larger objects.
*   **Drying:** CPE HG100 is hygroscopic and can absorb moisture from the air. If you notice stringing, popping sounds during printing, or poor layer adhesion, dry the filament before use. A filament dryer or a low-temperature oven (50-60°C for 4-6 hours) can be used.
*   **Nozzle Choice:** A hardened steel nozzle is recommended for long-term use as CPE can be abrasive. A brass nozzle can be used but will wear out faster.

## CPE HG100 vs. Other Fillamentum Filaments:

Within the Fillamentum range, CPE HG100 sits alongside materials like PLA, ABS, ASA, and other specialized filaments. Here's how it generally compares:

*   **PLA:** Easier to print than CPE HG100, but less durable and heat resistant. PLA is biodegradable, which can be advantageous.
*   **ABS:** Offers higher temperature resistance and toughness than CPE HG100, but requires higher printing temperatures and is more prone to warping. ABS also produces stronger fumes during printing.
*   **ASA:** Similar to ABS in terms of properties but offers better UV resistance, making it suitable for outdoor applications.
*   **PETG:** Similar to CPE HG100, but CPE HG100 offers higher chemical resistance and a glossier finish.

## Applications:

CPE HG100 is suitable for a wide range of applications, including:

*   Functional prototypes
*   End-use parts
*   Chemical-resistant components
*   Items requiring a glossy finish
*   Mechanical parts and tools
*   Enclosures and housings

## Conclusion:

Fillamentum CPE HG100 is a high-performance filament that offers a compelling combination of toughness, chemical resistance, and aesthetic appeal. While it requires slightly more precise printing parameters than PLA, its superior properties make it a worthwhile choice for a variety of demanding applications. By following the recommended usage tips and carefully tuning your printer settings, you can unlock the full potential of this versatile material.
