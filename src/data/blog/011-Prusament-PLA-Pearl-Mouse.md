## Prusament PLA Pearl Mouse: A Deep Dive into This Unique Filament

Prusament has carved a name for itself by producing high-quality, meticulously manufactured filaments. The Prusament PLA Pearl Mouse stands out, not just for its unusual name, but also for its captivating pearlescent finish and promising performance. This article delves into the specifications, usage recommendations, and overall quality of the Pearl Mouse filament, providing a comprehensive overview for 3D printing enthusiasts.

### What is Prusament PLA Pearl Mouse?

Prusament PLA Pearl Mouse is a PLA (Polylactic Acid) filament infused with a unique pearlescent additive. This additive gives prints a subtle, shimmering effect that elevates their aesthetic appeal. As with all Prusament filaments, it's manufactured under strict quality control measures, ensuring consistent diameter and minimal impurities.

### Detailed Specifications:

*   **Material:** PLA (Polylactic Acid) with pearlescent additive
*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm (±0.02mm tolerance)
*   **Spool Weight:** 1 kg
*   **Recommended Nozzle Temperature:** 215-230°C
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 50-60°C
*   **Density:** 1.24 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** 54 MPa
*   **Elongation at Break:** 15%
*   **Heat Resistance (VICAT):** 55°C
*   **Spool Dimensions:** Standard Prusament Spool (Fits most spool holders)

### Usage Tips for Optimal Results:

1.  **Preparation is Key:** Before printing, ensure your printer bed is properly leveled and clean. A clean bed promotes excellent adhesion. Use isopropyl alcohol to wipe the bed before each print.

2.  **Temperature Tuning:** While the recommended temperatures are a good starting point, experiment within the range to find what works best for your printer. Lower temperatures may result in weaker layer adhesion, while higher temperatures can lead to stringing. A temperature tower test is highly recommended.

3.  **Print Speed:** Moderate print speeds generally yield the best results with PLA. A speed of 40-60mm/s is a good starting point. Adjust based on the complexity of the print and your printer's capabilities.

4.  **Cooling Fan:** Proper cooling is crucial for PLA to maintain sharp details and prevent warping, especially for overhangs and bridges. Ensure your cooling fan is operating effectively.

5.  **First Layer Adhesion:** A well-tuned first layer is critical for successful prints. Adjust your Z-offset if necessary to achieve the perfect amount of "squish" on the first layer.

6.  **Storage:** PLA is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store the filament in a dry, airtight container with desiccant packets to prevent moisture-related issues like stringing and popping during printing.

7.  **Nozzle Material:** While PLA can be printed with a brass nozzle, a hardened steel nozzle may be beneficial for long-term use, especially if you plan to print abrasive filaments in the future.

8.  **Avoid Drafts:** Drafts can negatively impact print quality, especially for larger objects. Ensure your printer is in a stable environment free from significant drafts.

### Filament Quality Assessment:

Here's a breakdown of the Prusament PLA Pearl Mouse's performance in key areas, rated out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 9/10 - Produces prints with a smooth surface finish and excellent detail. The pearlescent effect adds a unique visual appeal.
*   **Toughness:** 7/10 - As a PLA, it's not inherently as tough as materials like PETG or ABS, but it's suitable for functional prints that don't require extreme impact resistance.
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 - PLA is generally rigid and not very flexible. This filament is no exception.
*   **Warping:** 8/10 - PLA is less prone to warping than ABS, especially with a heated bed and good adhesion.
*   **Adhesion:** 9/10 - Excellent adhesion to the bed when proper settings are used.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10 - PLA is susceptible to moisture absorption, which can negatively impact print quality. Proper storage is essential.
*   **Color Range:** 5/10 - The "Pearl Mouse" color is a specific offering, and the overall color range for pearlescent Prusament PLAs might be limited compared to standard PLA.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 - The recommended temperature range is relatively forgiving, allowing for fine-tuning to your printer's specific characteristics.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9/10 - PLA is known for its low odor and minimal fume production during printing, making it a safer option for enclosed spaces.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 10/10 - Prusament is renowned for its exceptional spool winding, preventing tangles and ensuring a smooth printing experience.

**Average Score: 7.4/10**

### Conclusion:

The Prusament PLA Pearl Mouse is a high-quality filament that delivers excellent print quality and a unique aesthetic appeal. Its ease of use and consistent performance make it a great choice for both beginners and experienced 3D printing enthusiasts. While it may not be the toughest or most flexible material, its visual appeal and reliable performance make it a valuable addition to any filament collection. Its moisture sensitivity needs attention. Overall a high quality PLA.
