# Diving Deep into Prusament PETG Ultramarine Blue: A Comprehensive Review

Prusament has built a strong reputation for producing high-quality 3D printing filaments, and their PETG Ultramarine Blue is no exception. This vibrant, reliable filament promises excellent results for a variety of printing applications. Let's delve into the specifics of this filament and see what it has to offer.

## Specifications

*   **Material:** Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG)

## Understanding PETG

PETG is a popular choice for 3D printing due to its blend of properties. It combines the ease of printing associated with PLA with the strength and durability of ABS. It's known for its good layer adhesion, low warping, and resistance to moisture. This makes it a versatile material suitable for both functional parts and aesthetic prints.

## Unboxing and First Impressions

The Prusament PETG Ultramarine Blue arrives vacuum-sealed with a desiccant packet, ensuring the filament remains dry during storage and transit. The spool is neatly wound, exhibiting the high level of quality control Prusament is known for. The Ultramarine Blue color is vibrant and consistent across the entire spool.

## Printing Tips for Optimal Results

To get the best results with Prusament PETG Ultramarine Blue, consider these tips:

*   **Temperature Settings:** Start within the recommended temperature range of 230-250°C for the hot end and 80-90°C for the bed. Fine-tune these settings based on your printer and the specific model you're printing. A temperature tower is always a good idea.

*   **Bed Adhesion:** PETG can sometimes be a bit sticky, so ensure your bed is properly leveled and clean. A PEI sheet is generally the recommended surface for PETG but other surfaces work just fine.

*   **Print Speed:** While PETG can handle relatively high print speeds, reducing the speed slightly (40-60 mm/s) can improve layer adhesion and reduce stringing.

*   **Cooling:** PETG requires less cooling than PLA, but some cooling is still beneficial, especially for intricate details and bridging. Start with 20-40% fan speed and adjust as needed.

*   **Retraction:** Proper retraction settings are crucial to minimize stringing and blobs. Experiment with retraction distance (1-6 mm) and retraction speed (25-40 mm/s) to find the optimal settings for your printer.

*   **Moisture Control:** Although PETG is less hygroscopic than some other filaments, it can still absorb moisture over time. If you live in a humid environment or notice printing issues like popping or hissing, consider drying the filament before use. A filament dryer or a low-temperature oven can be used for this purpose.

*   **First Layer:** The first layer is the most important. Slow it down to 20mm/s and increase the bed temperature by 5-10°C for that first layer for the best adhestion.

## Print Quality, Toughness, and Overall Performance

Here's a breakdown of Prusament PETG Ultramarine Blue based on our testing criteria:

*   **Print Quality:** (9/10) – This filament delivers excellent print quality with minimal stringing and good surface finish when dialed in properly. Fine details are well-reproduced, and layer adhesion is strong.

*   **Toughness:** (8/10) – PETG is known for its toughness, and Prusament's formulation doesn't disappoint. Prints are durable and can withstand moderate stress and impact.

*   **Flexibility:** (6/10) – PETG is more flexible than PLA but less so than TPU. It offers a moderate amount of flex, making it suitable for parts that require some give but not extreme flexibility.

*   **Warping:** (8/10) – Warping is minimal with PETG, especially with a heated bed and proper adhesion. Large prints may require a brim for added stability.

*   **Adhesion:** (8/10) – PETG adheres well to various bed surfaces. A PEI sheet or glass bed with adhesive is generally recommended for optimal adhesion.

*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** (7/10) – PETG is less sensitive to moisture than PLA but can still absorb moisture over time. Proper storage in a dry environment is recommended.

*   **Color Range:** (7/10) – Prusament offers a decent range of PETG colors, with Ultramarine Blue being a standout.

*   **Temperature Range:** (8/10) – The recommended temperature range of 230-250°C provides a good balance between ease of printing and material properties.

*   **Odor & Fumes:** (8/10) – PETG has a very faint odor during printing, which is significantly less noticeable than ABS.

*   **Spool Winding Quality:** (10/10) – Prusament is known for its excellent spool winding, which minimizes the risk of tangles and print failures.

## Overall Score

Taking the average of all the scores above, Prusament PETG Ultramarine Blue receives an **overall score of 7.9/10**. This is a strong score, reflecting the filament's excellent print quality, toughness, and ease of use.
