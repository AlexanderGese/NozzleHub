## Deep Dive into be3D DeeRed Ember: A Filament Review

The be3D DeeRed Ember filament has been making waves in the 3D printing community. Known for its vibrant color and potential for robust prints, it's worth taking a closer look to see how it stacks up. This article will provide a detailed review, focusing on the filament's properties and how it performs in practical applications.

**What is be3D DeeRed Ember?**

DeeRed Ember is a PLA (Polylactic Acid) filament manufactured by be3D. PLA is a popular thermoplastic material in 3D printing, valued for being relatively easy to print, biodegradable (under specific industrial conditions), and offering good dimensional accuracy. DeeRed Ember distinguishes itself with its distinctive, rich red hue, making it ideal for projects where visual appeal is crucial.

**Detailed Specifications:**

While specific numerical specifications can vary slightly between batches, the general properties of be3D DeeRed Ember are typically within these ranges:

*   **Material:** PLA (Polylactic Acid)
*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm (check your spool for variations)
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 190-220°C (374-428°F) - Adjust based on your printer and environmental conditions.
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 50-60°C (122-140°F) - Not always necessary, but it can improve adhesion.
*   **Density:** ~1.24 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** ~50 MPa
*   **Elongation at Break:** ~7%

**Usage Tips & Best Practices:**

Getting the most out of DeeRed Ember requires a few considerations:

*   **Temperature Tuning:** The optimal printing temperature can vary depending on your printer, ambient temperature, and print speed. It's always wise to perform temperature tower tests to fine-tune the ideal nozzle temperature for your setup. Start within the recommended range and adjust in 5°C increments.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** While PLA is generally good with adhesion, DeeRed Ember benefits from a clean, level print bed. Using a glue stick, painter's tape, or PEI bed can greatly improve first-layer adhesion, especially for large prints or those with small contact areas.
*   **Cooling:** PLA benefits from good cooling. Ensure your printer's cooling fan is adequately cooling the filament as it's extruded. This helps prevent warping and improve overhang quality.
*   **Storage:** PLA is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store your DeeRed Ember filament in an airtight container with desiccant packs when not in use to prevent moisture absorption. Moisture can lead to brittle prints, stringing, and poor surface finish.
*   **Print Speed:** While you can generally print PLA at moderate speeds, dialing back the speed slightly, especially for intricate details, can improve print quality. Start with a print speed of around 50-60mm/s and adjust as needed.
*   **Retraction Settings:** Fine-tuning your printer's retraction settings is crucial for minimizing stringing with PLA. Experiment with retraction distance and speed to find the optimal settings for your printer and DeeRed Ember filament.
*   **First Layer:** A well-executed first layer is critical to a successful print. Ensure your bed is properly leveled and that the nozzle is at the correct height. Consider adjusting the first layer speed and flow rate to ensure proper adhesion.

**Performance Assessment:**

Now, let's evaluate DeeRed Ember across key performance categories:

*   **Print Quality (8/10):** DeeRed Ember generally produces prints with good detail and a smooth surface finish. With proper tuning, layer adhesion is excellent. However, it's not immune to the typical PLA imperfections like minor stringing if settings aren't dialed in.
*   **Toughness (7/10):** As a standard PLA, DeeRed Ember offers decent rigidity but may not be the best choice for parts requiring high impact resistance or flexibility.  For highly stressed parts, consider using other filaments.
*   **Flexibility (3/10):** DeeRed Ember, like most standard PLAs, exhibits limited flexibility. It's brittle and not suitable for applications requiring bending or flexing.
*   **Warping (8/10):** Warping is minimal with DeeRed Ember, especially when a heated bed is used. Good bed adhesion further reduces the risk of warping. Larger prints might require careful temperature control and enclosure for optimal results.
*   **Adhesion (9/10):** Excellent bed adhesion is one of the strengths of DeeRed Ember, especially with a heated bed and proper surface preparation (glue stick, tape, PEI).
*   **Moisture Sensitivity (6/10):** PLA is known to absorb moisture from the air, and DeeRed Ember is no exception. Proper storage is critical to maintain print quality and prevent issues.
*   **Color Range (N/A):** We're focusing on DeeRed Ember.
*   **Temperature Range (7/10):** The recommended temperature range (190-220°C) is standard for PLA. DeeRed Ember performs well within this range.
*   **Odor & Fumes (9/10):** PLA is known for having a minimal odor during printing, and DeeRed Ember is no different. The faint, sweet smell is generally considered non-offensive.
*   **Spool Winding Quality (8/10):** A well-wound spool is crucial for preventing tangles and ensuring smooth printing. DeeRed Ember generally exhibits good spool winding quality.

**Final Verdict:**

The be3D DeeRed Ember filament offers a reliable and visually appealing option for your 3D printing projects. Its ease of use, excellent bed adhesion, and vibrant color make it a great choice for both beginners and experienced users. While it's not the toughest or most flexible filament, its strengths in print quality and ease of use make it a valuable addition to any filament collection. Just remember to store it properly to prevent moisture absorption and fine-tune your print settings for optimal results.

**Overall Average Score:** 7.4/10
