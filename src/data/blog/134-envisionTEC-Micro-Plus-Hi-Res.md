## The EnvisionTEC Micro Plus Hi-Res: A Deep Dive into Detail

The EnvisionTEC Micro Plus Hi-Res is a 3D printer that caters specifically to applications demanding extreme precision and detail. It's not your everyday desktop FDM printer; instead, it leverages DLP (Digital Light Processing) technology to create objects with incredibly fine resolutions, making it a go-to choice for industries like jewelry, dental, and audiology. Let's take a closer look at what makes this machine tick.

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Technology:** DLP (Digital Light Processing)
*   **Build Volume:** 45 x 28 x 100 mm (1.77 x 1.1 x 3.94 inches) - *This is a deliberately small build volume, optimized for detailed parts, not bulk production.*
*   **XY Resolution:** 30 µm (0.0012 inches) - *This is the key factor for high-resolution printing.*
*   **Dynamic Z Resolution:** 25 µm to 100 µm (0.001 inch to 0.004 inch) - *Layer thickness can be adjusted to balance speed and resolution.*
*   **Light Source:** High-power LED with UV Projector
*   **Material Compatibility:** Specialized EnvisionTEC resins (e.g., E-Dent 400, E-RigidForm, RC-31) - *Material selection is limited to EnvisionTEC's proprietary resins, offering specific performance characteristics.*
*   **Connectivity:** Ethernet, USB
*   **Software:** EnvisionTEC Perfactory Software Suite
*   **Machine Dimensions:** 330 x 260 x 530 mm (13 x 10.2 x 20.9 inches)
*   **Weight:** ~17 kg (37.5 lbs)
*   **Power Requirements:** 100-240V, 50/60 Hz

**Usage Tips for Optimal Results:**

*   **Resin Selection is Crucial:** The Micro Plus Hi-Res relies on EnvisionTEC's specifically formulated resins. Choose the correct resin for your application (jewelry casting, dental models, functional prototypes, etc.). Read the material data sheets carefully.
*   **Orientation Matters:** Part orientation is critical in DLP printing. Minimize the cross-sectional area of each layer to reduce stress on the part and supports during printing. Think about the part's geometry and how it will peel away from the build platform.
*   **Support Generation:** Use the EnvisionTEC software to generate robust, yet easily removable, supports. Proper support placement is essential to prevent warping and ensure dimensional accuracy, especially for overhanging features.
*   **Leveling the Build Platform:** Ensure the build platform is perfectly level. This is critical for first-layer adhesion and overall print quality. Follow EnvisionTEC's recommended leveling procedure.
*   **Cleanliness is Key:** Keep the resin vat and optical surfaces clean. Contamination can negatively impact print quality. Use appropriate cleaning solutions and lint-free cloths as recommended by EnvisionTEC.
*   **Post-Processing:** DLP printed parts often require post-processing, including support removal, cleaning (using isopropyl alcohol), and UV curing to fully harden the resin. Follow EnvisionTEC's recommended post-processing procedures for each specific resin.
*   **Temperature Control:** Maintain a stable and appropriate ambient temperature in your printing environment. Some resins are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations than others. Consult the resin data sheet.
*   **Software Familiarity:** Invest time in learning the EnvisionTEC Perfactory Software Suite. Mastering its features for support generation, part orientation, and print parameter adjustments will significantly improve your results.
*   **Resin Shelf Life:** Be mindful of the resin's expiration date. Expired resin may not print properly or may result in parts with degraded mechanical properties.
*   **Ventilation:** Ensure adequate ventilation in your workspace, especially when handling resins and cleaning solvents. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and eye protection.

**Evaluation:**

Here is an evaluation of the EnvisionTEC Micro Plus Hi-Res on the specified criteria, each rated out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 10/10 - Exceptional detail and surface finish are the hallmarks of this printer.
*   **Build Volume:** 4/10 - Deliberately small, optimized for high-resolution, small parts.
*   **Printing Speed:** 6/10 - Not the fastest, prioritizing quality over speed. DLP is generally faster than SLA, but smaller layers and resolutions slow things down.
*   **Material Compatibility:** 5/10 - Limited to EnvisionTEC's proprietary resins, but those resins are specifically formulated for high-performance applications.
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 7/10 - Critical, requires careful attention to detail but generally reliable when properly set up.
*   **Reliability:** 7/10 - Requires regular maintenance and care, but generally reliable when used within its specified parameters and with proper materials.
*   **Ease of Use:** 6/10 - More complex than a basic FDM printer. Requires familiarity with DLP printing and the EnvisionTEC software.
*   **Firmware and Software:** 7/10 - EnvisionTEC's software is powerful but has a steeper learning curve than some simpler 3D printing software packages.
*   **Connectivity Options:** 6/10 - Basic Ethernet and USB connectivity are adequate, but lacking advanced features like Wi-Fi.
*   **Build Quality & Durability:** 8/10 - Sturdy construction, designed for professional use.
*   **Noise Level:** 7/10 - Relatively quiet compared to some other 3D printing technologies.
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** 6/10 - Requires regular cleaning of the resin vat, platform, and optical surfaces. Resin replacement is also a factor.
*   **Customer Support:** 7/10 - EnvisionTEC (now part of Desktop Metal) offers support, but response times and the level of expertise can vary.
*   **Upgradeability:** 4/10 - Limited upgrade options available for this specific model.
*   **Price to Performance Ratio:** 7/10 - Expensive, but the superior print quality and accuracy justify the cost for specialized applications where those factors are paramount.

**Average Score:** 6.67/10

**Conclusion:**

The EnvisionTEC Micro Plus Hi-Res is a specialized tool designed for professionals who demand the highest level of detail and accuracy in their 3D printed parts. While it has a smaller build volume and requires more specialized knowledge than many other 3D printers, it excels in its niche. If your application requires micron-level precision, this printer is a strong contender. However, be prepared for the higher cost of entry, the learning curve associated with DLP printing, and the reliance on proprietary resins.
