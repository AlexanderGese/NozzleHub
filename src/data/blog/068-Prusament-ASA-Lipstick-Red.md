# Prusament ASA Lipstick Red: A Deep Dive into Performance and Application

Prusament ASA Lipstick Red is a robust engineering-grade filament known for its UV resistance, high-temperature resistance, and durability. This article will explore the filament's specifications, delve into practical printing tips, and provide an objective assessment of its performance in key areas.

## What is ASA Filament?

Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA) is a thermoplastic polymer, a close relative to ABS, but with superior UV resistance. This makes it ideal for outdoor applications where parts are exposed to sunlight and weathering. ASA is also known for its higher impact strength compared to ABS and its resistance to certain chemicals.

## Prusament ASA Lipstick Red: Specifications

*   **Manufacturer:** Prusa Research
*   **Material:** ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate)
*   **Color:** Lipstick Red (a vibrant, rich red hue)
*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm (+/- 0.03mm tolerance)

## Printing Tips for Optimal Results

Achieving excellent results with Prusament ASA Lipstick Red requires attention to a few key factors:

*   **Enclosure is Key:** ASA is prone to warping if exposed to drafts or uneven cooling. An enclosure is highly recommended to maintain a stable ambient temperature.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** A heated bed is essential, and good adhesion is crucial. Using a glue stick, PEI sheet, or textured powder-coated sheet will help prevent warping and ensure the first layer adheres properly. A brim can also be beneficial for larger prints.
*   **Temperature Control:** Carefully adjust the nozzle and bed temperatures. Start within the recommended range and fine-tune based on your specific printer and environmental conditions.
*   **Cooling Fan:** Reduce or disable the cooling fan. Excessive cooling can contribute to warping. Only use minimal cooling if necessary for bridging or overhangs.
*   **Print Speed:** Moderate print speeds typically produce better results. Avoid printing too quickly, as this can lead to adhesion issues and layer separation.
*   **Draft Shield:** Consider printing with a draft shield (a single-layer wall around the perimeter of the print) to further minimize warping.
*   **Dry Filament:** ASA is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. If you suspect your filament is damp, dry it in a filament dryer before printing.
*   **Ventilation:** ASA emits fumes during printing. Ensure adequate ventilation in your printing area.

## Prusament ASA Lipstick Red: Performance Ratings

Here's a rating of Prusament ASA Lipstick Red based on key performance criteria (out of 10):

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 (Can produce detailed parts with proper settings)
*   **Toughness:** 9/10 (High impact resistance and durability)
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 (Not flexible, rigid material)
*   **Warping:** 6/10 (Prone to warping without proper precautions)
*   **Adhesion:** 7/10 (Good adhesion with correct bed surface and temperature)
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 5/10 (Hygroscopic, requires drying if exposed to moisture)
*   **Color Range:** 7/10 (Lipstick Red is a vibrant, well-pigmented color)
*   **Temperature Range:** 9/10 (Excellent high-temperature resistance)
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 4/10 (Stronger odor and fumes compared to PLA, requiring ventilation)
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 10/10 (Excellent, consistent winding)

**Average Score: 6.8/10**

## Conclusion

Prusament ASA Lipstick Red offers excellent strength, durability, and UV resistance, making it a valuable material for functional parts and outdoor applications. While it requires more attention to printing parameters compared to PLA, the results are well worth the effort. By following the recommended printing tips and understanding the material's properties, you can consistently produce high-quality, robust parts with this vibrant red filament.
