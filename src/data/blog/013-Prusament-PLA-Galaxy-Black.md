# Diving Deep into Prusament PLA Galaxy Black: A Comprehensive Guide

Prusament has become a household name in the 3D printing community, synonymous with high-quality filaments and consistent results. Among their wide array of offerings, Prusament PLA Galaxy Black stands out with its unique aesthetic and reliable performance. This article provides an in-depth look at this captivating filament, covering its specifications, practical usage tips, and a critical evaluation of its key properties.

## What Makes Prusament PLA Galaxy Black Special?

Prusament PLA Galaxy Black isn't just black filament; it's black with a personality. The "Galaxy" designation comes from the subtle, shimmering specks embedded within the filament, giving prints a unique, almost stardust-like appearance. This effect is especially noticeable under direct light and adds a touch of sophistication to your creations.

## Detailed Specifications

*   **Material:** PLA (Polylactic Acid)
*   **Diameter:** Typically 1.75mm +/- 0.02mm (Prusament's tight tolerances are a key feature)
*   **Spool Weight:** 1kg (2.2 lbs)
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 215 ± 10 °C
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 60 ± 10 °C
*   **Density:** 1.24 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** 54 MPa
*   **Elongation at Break:** 7%
*   **Made in:** Czech Republic (Prusament is manufactured in-house by Prusa Research)
*   **Color:** Black with subtle silver glitter-like flakes.

## Usage Tips for Optimal Results

While PLA is generally considered one of the easier materials to print with, here are some tips to maximize your success with Prusament PLA Galaxy Black:

*   **Temperature Tuning:** Start with the recommended printing temperature of 215°C and bed temperature of 60°C. Fine-tune these settings based on your printer and environment. If you see stringing, lower the temperature by 5°C increments. If you experience poor layer adhesion, increase the temperature by similar increments.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** Ensure your bed is clean and level. Applying a thin layer of glue stick or using a PEI bed surface can further improve adhesion, especially for larger prints.
*   **Cooling:** Adequate cooling is essential for PLA. Use your printer's cooling fan at 100% for most prints. For smaller, intricate parts, consider increasing the fan speed or using multiple fans.
*   **Print Speed:** A moderate print speed of 40-60mm/s typically yields excellent results. Slower speeds can improve detail and layer adhesion, while faster speeds can reduce print time (at the potential expense of quality).
*   **Enclosure (Optional):** While not always necessary for PLA, an enclosure can help maintain a consistent temperature, reducing the risk of warping, especially in cooler environments.
*   **Storage:** Store your Prusament PLA Galaxy Black in a dry, airtight container with desiccant to prevent moisture absorption. This is crucial for maintaining print quality and preventing brittle filament.
*   **First Layer Calibration:** Because of the fine detail and reflective nature of this filament, ensure your first layer calibration is on point. A well-squished first layer will help the rest of the print stick.
*   **Use OctoPrint, Prusa Link, or Similar:** The remote access and monitoring capabilities of these programs really help keep an eye on those longer prints.

## Evaluating Prusament PLA Galaxy Black

Here's an evaluation of Prusament PLA Galaxy Black across various categories, rated on a scale of 1 to 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 9/10 - Delivers consistent, high-resolution prints with excellent detail. The subtle shimmer adds visual interest without compromising accuracy.
*   **Toughness:** 7/10 - PLA is generally not as strong as materials like PETG or ABS, but Prusament PLA exhibits above-average toughness for a PLA.
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 - PLA is a rigid material with very limited flexibility.
*   **Warping:** 9/10 - PLA is known for its low warping tendency, and Prusament PLA Galaxy Black performs exceptionally well in this regard.
*   **Adhesion:** 8/10 - Adheres well to a properly prepared print bed. Some additional bed adhesion assistance might be needed if your bed isn't perfect.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10 - Like all PLA filaments, it is susceptible to moisture absorption. Proper storage is crucial.
*   **Color Range:** 6/10 - While the Galaxy Black is a unique color, the overall color range is currently limited to just that option.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 - Relatively wide processing window, making it easier to dial in the perfect settings.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9/10 - Produces minimal odor during printing, making it a good choice for enclosed spaces.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 10/10 - Prusament is renowned for its impeccable spool winding, which minimizes the risk of tangles and print failures.

**Average Score: 7.5/10**

## Conclusion

Prusament PLA Galaxy Black is a compelling filament choice for anyone seeking high-quality PLA with a unique aesthetic. Its reliable performance, coupled with its captivating visual appeal, makes it an excellent option for a wide range of 3D printing projects. While it might not be the strongest or most flexible material available, its ease of use, low warping, and consistent results make it a valuable addition to any 3D printing enthusiast's arsenal.
