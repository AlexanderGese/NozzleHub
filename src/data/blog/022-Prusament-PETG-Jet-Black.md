## Prusament PETG Jet Black: A Deep Dive into Premium Printing

Prusament has carved out a reputation for high-quality filaments, and their PETG Jet Black is no exception. This filament promises consistent results and a beautiful, deep black finish. Let's break down everything you need to know about Prusament PETG Jet Black, from its specifications to practical usage tips.

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Material:** Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG)
*   **Color:** Jet Black (A true, deep black)
*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm (Nominal)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** ± 0.02 mm (Industry leading precision)
*   **Recommended Nozzle Temperature:** 230-250 °C (446-482 °F)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 80-90 °C (176-194 °F)
*   **Recommended Printing Speed:** 40-60 mm/s (Adjust based on printer and part complexity)
*   **Spool Weight:** 1 kg (2.2 lbs)
*   **Spool Dimensions:** Standard Spool Dimensions for easy fitment
*   **Density:** 1.27 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** 52 MPa
*   **Elongation at Break:** 7%

**Key Features and Benefits:**

*   **Exceptional Dimensional Accuracy:** Prusament is known for its tight tolerances, ensuring consistent extrusion and accurate prints. This is crucial for parts that require precise fitting.
*   **Good Strength and Durability:** PETG offers a good balance of strength and flexibility, making it suitable for functional parts and prototypes. It's more durable than PLA.
*   **Relatively Low Warping:** PETG is less prone to warping than ABS, making it easier to print larger parts.
*   **Good Layer Adhesion:** Proper temperature settings will result in excellent layer adhesion, creating strong, durable prints.
*   **Easy to Print:** PETG is generally easier to print than ABS, making it a good choice for both beginners and experienced users.
*   **Food Safe (Conditionally):** PETG is considered food-safe, but it's essential to verify this for the specific Prusament PETG batch and your printer setup. Layer lines can harbor bacteria, so special post-processing might be needed for food-contact applications.
*   **Resistant to Chemicals and Moisture:** PETG offers reasonable resistance to various chemicals and moisture, making it suitable for applications where exposure to these elements is possible.
*   **Consistent Color:** Prusament is renowned for the consistency of its colors, ensuring that your prints are always the shade you expect.

**Usage Tips for Optimal Results:**

1.  **Drying:** PETG is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. If your filament has been exposed to humidity, consider drying it before printing. Use a filament dryer or an oven at a low temperature (around 50°C or 122°F) for several hours.
2.  **Bed Adhesion:** Proper bed adhesion is crucial for successful PETG prints. Clean your print bed with isopropyl alcohol or a dedicated bed cleaner. Use a PEI sheet, glass bed with adhesive, or painter's tape for optimal adhesion.
3.  **First Layer Calibration:** Ensure your first layer is properly calibrated. The nozzle should be close enough to the bed to create a slightly squished layer, but not so close that it restricts extrusion.
4.  **Temperature Settings:** Start with the recommended nozzle and bed temperatures (230-250°C and 80-90°C, respectively) and adjust based on your printer and environmental conditions.
5.  **Fan Speed:** Reduce fan speed to prevent warping and improve layer adhesion. Start with a low fan speed (20-40%) and increase it if necessary to improve bridging or overhangs.
6.  **Retraction Settings:** Fine-tune your retraction settings to minimize stringing. Experiment with retraction distance and speed to find the optimal settings for your printer.
7.  **Print Speed:** Reduce your print speed, especially for intricate details or overhangs. A slower print speed allows the filament to cool and solidify properly, resulting in better quality.
8.  **Enclosure (Optional):** Using an enclosure can help to maintain a consistent temperature around the print, reducing warping and improving layer adhesion.

**Prusament PETG Jet Black Scores:**

*   **Print Quality:** 9/10
*   **Toughness:** 8/10
*   **Flexibility:** 6/10
*   **Warping:** 8/10
*   **Adhesion:** 9/10
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10
*   **Color Range:** 1/10 (limited to Jet Black)
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 8/10
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 10/10

**Average Score: 7.3/10**

**Conclusion:**

Prusament PETG Jet Black is a premium filament that delivers excellent print quality, strength, and ease of use. While it might be slightly more expensive than some other PETG filaments on the market, the consistent quality and beautiful finish make it a worthwhile investment for those who demand the best. With proper settings and techniques, you can achieve outstanding results with this filament, producing durable and aesthetically pleasing prints.
