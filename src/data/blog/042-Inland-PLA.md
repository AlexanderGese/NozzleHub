## Diving Deep into Inland PLA Filament: A Comprehensive Guide

Inland PLA has carved a niche for itself in the 3D printing world, often praised for its affordability and ease of use. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Inland PLA, covering everything from its specifications to practical usage tips, without comparing it to other specific filaments or printers. We'll focus solely on evaluating Inland PLA based on its inherent properties and performance.

**What is Inland PLA?**

PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a thermoplastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane. Inland, a popular brand sold primarily through Micro Center, offers its own version of PLA filament. PLA is known for being relatively easy to print, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced users alike. It's also biodegradable under specific industrial composting conditions.

**Detailed Specifications**

While exact specifications can vary slightly based on color and batch, here are general specifications you can expect from Inland PLA:

*   **Filament Diameter:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm (though 1.75mm is far more common)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** ± 0.05mm (This ensures consistent flow and print quality)
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 190-220°C (This range can vary depending on your printer and ambient temperature)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 50-70°C (Though many users have success without a heated bed using adhesion aids)
*   **Tensile Strength:** Varies, but generally around 50-60 MPa (A measure of its resistance to being pulled apart)
*   **Density:** Approximately 1.24 g/cm³
*   **Spool Weight:** Typically 1 kg (2.2 lbs)

**Usage Tips and Best Practices**

To maximize your success with Inland PLA, consider these tips:

*   **Temperature Tuning:** Experiment with the printing temperature within the recommended range. Start in the middle (e.g., 205°C) and adjust in small increments based on print quality. Too high, and you might see stringing or oozing. Too low, and layers might not adhere well.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** PLA generally adheres well to a variety of surfaces.  Clean the bed thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol before each print. If you're having trouble, consider using a bed adhesive like glue stick, hairspray (aquanet), or painter's tape. A heated bed (50-70°C) can also significantly improve adhesion.
*   **Cooling:** PLA benefits from good cooling. Use your printer's cooling fan at 100% for most of the print. This helps prevent warping and ensures sharp details.
*   **Print Speed:** A moderate print speed (40-60 mm/s) generally works well with PLA. Faster speeds may require higher temperatures.
*   **Storage:** PLA is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store your filament in a sealed container with desiccant packs when not in use to prevent brittleness and print quality issues.
*   **First Layer:** A crucial factor! Ensure your first layer is properly calibrated. The nozzle should be close enough to the bed to create a slightly squished layer.
*   **Retraction Settings:** Experiment with retraction settings to minimize stringing. Higher retraction distance and speed can help, but too much can cause jams.
*   **Bridging and Overhangs:** PLA can handle moderate bridging and overhangs, but significant overhangs may require supports. Use appropriate support settings in your slicing software.

**Inland PLA: A Performance Evaluation (Out of 10)**

Based on general user experiences and the inherent properties of Inland PLA, here's a performance evaluation across key categories:

*   **Print Quality:** 7/10 - Good for most applications, with decent detail resolution.
*   **Toughness:** 5/10 - Relatively brittle compared to other materials like ABS or PETG.
*   **Flexibility:** 2/10 - Very little flexibility. Prone to snapping rather than bending.
*   **Warping:** 8/10 - Low warping tendency, especially with a heated bed.
*   **Adhesion:** 8/10 - Excellent adhesion to a variety of print surfaces with proper preparation.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10 - Moderate moisture sensitivity. Requires proper storage.
*   **Color Range:** 9/10 - Available in a wide variety of colors and finishes.
*   **Temperature Range:** 7/10 - Relatively narrow temperature range, but easy to dial in.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9/10 - Very low odor and fumes during printing.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 7/10 - Generally well-wound, but occasional tangles can occur.

**Average Score: 7.1/10**

**Conclusion**

Inland PLA offers a good balance of affordability and performance. It is a solid choice for general-purpose 3D printing, especially for beginners and users who prioritize ease of use and low odor. While it may not be the toughest or most flexible filament, its low warping tendency and good adhesion make it a reliable option for a wide range of projects. By following the tips outlined in this guide, you can maximize your success and achieve excellent results with Inland PLA.
