## Entina Tina2: A Deep Dive into This Compact 3D Printer

The Entina Tina2 has carved a niche for itself in the world of budget-friendly, beginner-friendly 3D printers. Its compact size and attractive price point make it a compelling option for those just dipping their toes into the 3D printing realm or anyone needing a small, portable printing solution. Let's take a thorough look at what the Tina2 offers, covering its specifications, practical usage tips, and overall performance.

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Filament Diameter:** 1.75 mm
*   **Supported Materials:** PLA
*   **Printing Speed:** 10-40 mm/s (Recommended)
*   **Connectivity:** MicroSD Card
*   **Display:** LCD
*   **Power Supply:** 12V/3A
*   **Dimensions:** 215 x 215 x 255 mm (8.5 x 8.5 x 10 inches)
*   **Weight:** 3 kg (6.6 lbs)

**Usage Tips for Optimal Results:**

The Entina Tina2, while beginner-friendly, still benefits from careful setup and attention to detail. Here are some key tips to help you achieve the best possible prints:

1.  **Leveling the Bed:** Bed leveling is arguably the most crucial step. The Tina2 features manual bed leveling, which requires patience and precision. Use a piece of paper or feeler gauge to ensure consistent spacing between the nozzle and the print bed at all four corners. Small adjustments can make a big difference. Re-level the bed periodically, especially after moving the printer.

2.  **Filament Management:** PLA is generally straightforward to print with, but storing it properly is crucial. Keep your filament in a dry environment, preferably in a sealed container with desiccant packs. Moisture absorption can lead to stringing and poor print quality.

3.  **Temperature Settings:** Start with the recommended temperatures for PLA: 200°C for the nozzle and 60°C for the bed. Adjust these temperatures in small increments based on your specific filament and the ambient temperature. Too hot can cause warping or excessive stringing, while too cold can lead to poor layer adhesion.

4.  **Adhesion Aids:** For challenging prints, consider using adhesion aids like painter's tape, glue stick, or hairspray on the print bed. These can help prevent warping and ensure that your prints stick firmly to the build surface.

5.  **Slicing Software:** The Tina2 works well with popular slicing software like Cura and Simplify3D. Experiment with different slicing settings to fine-tune your print quality. Important settings include layer height, print speed, infill density, and support structures.

6.  **Print Speed:** While the printer is advertised with a max speed of 40mm/s its best to stick around 25mm/s-30mm/s. This will drastically affect the print quality and the amount of problems faced during printing.

**Rating Metrics for Entina Tina2:**

Here is an overall ranking of its qualities out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 6/10 (Good for small parts and prototypes, less detailed prints)
*   **Build Volume:** 3/10 (Very limited build volume)
