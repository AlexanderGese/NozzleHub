*   **Weight:** 19.5 kg (43 lbs)

**Usage Tips for Optimal Results:**

The TAZ Workhorse, while generally user-friendly, benefits from a few key practices to ensure optimal print quality and longevity:

*   **Bed Leveling is Key:** The TAZ Workhorse utilizes an auto-leveling system, but manually verifying the bed level occasionally is still recommended. Ensure the nozzle is the correct distance from the bed. Too far, and you'll have adhesion issues. Too close, and you risk filament clogging or a warped first layer. Pay extra attention when switching between materials with different printing temperatures.
*   **Experiment with Filament Profiles:** While the TAZ Workhorse comes with pre-configured profiles for various filaments, experimenting with settings like temperature, print speed, and retraction can greatly improve print quality for specific filament brands or unique projects.
*   **Maintain a Clean Print Bed:** Regularly clean the PEI bed with isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher) to remove any residue and ensure proper adhesion. Avoid touching the print surface with your fingers, as oils can hinder adhesion.
*   **Proper Filament Storage:** Keep your filament dry. Humidity can significantly impact print quality, especially for materials like nylon and PETG. Store filament in airtight containers with desiccant packets.
*   **Regular Maintenance:** Regularly inspect and lubricate moving parts. Keep the nozzle clean and free of debris. Periodically check and tighten screws.
*   **Temperature Tuning:** While the heated bed and enclosure-readiness offer wide material compatibility, take the time to do temperature towers and fine-tune your extrusion temp for each roll of filament. Different colors, even from the same brand, can vary slightly.
*   **Support Structures:** Simplify support structures with the "conical support" option. Simplify will offer better support removal and a cleaner final product.
