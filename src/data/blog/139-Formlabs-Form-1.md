## The Formlabs Form 1: A Deep Dive into Early Desktop SLA Printing

The Formlabs Form 1, released in 2012, marked a significant step in bringing stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing technology to the desktop. Before its arrival, SLA was largely confined to industrial settings due to the high cost and complexity of the machinery. The Form 1 aimed to change that, offering high-resolution printing at a more accessible price point. While now a piece of 3D printing history, it's worth revisiting this pioneering machine to understand its capabilities and limitations.

**What is SLA Printing?**

Unlike Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) which melts and extrudes plastic filament, SLA uses a laser to cure liquid resin layer by layer. This results in parts with smoother surfaces and finer details than what's typically achievable with FDM. The Form 1 utilizes a process called inverted SLA, where the laser shines upwards through a transparent resin tank floor, curing the resin and building the part upside down.

**Unboxing and Setting Up:**

The initial unboxing experience was generally positive. The Form 1 felt well-built, and the packaging was designed to protect the delicate components during shipping. Setting up the printer involved installing the software, filling the resin tank, and leveling the build platform. While the process was generally straightforward, the leveling procedure could be a bit finicky, requiring careful adjustments to ensure proper adhesion.

**Working with the Form 1:**

The workflow for using the Form 1 starts with preparing your 3D model in Formlabs' PreForm software. This software allows you to orient your model, generate supports, and slice it into layers. The software communicates wirelessly with the Form 1 to send printing instructions, and shows you the progress. A key aspect of the Form 1's operation is the importance of proper support generation. SLA printing requires extensive supports to hold the part in place during printing and to prevent deformation.

**Common Challenges & Things to Look Out For:**

*   **Resin Handling:** SLA resin is photosensitive and can be messy to work with. Spills should be cleaned up immediately with isopropyl alcohol. The resin tank needs to be stored properly to prevent curing and degradation.
*   **Support Removal:** Removing supports from SLA prints can be tricky. They often leave small blemishes on the surface of the part. Sharp tools and patience are essential.
*   **Post-Curing:** After printing, parts need to be washed in isopropyl alcohol to remove any uncured resin. They then need to be post-cured under UV light to fully harden. This step is crucial for achieving optimal strength and dimensional stability.
*   **Layer Adhesion Issues:** Especially with early resins and less-than-perfect printer calibration, layer adhesion could occasionally be a problem. This often manifested as delamination or warping.
*   **Resin Compatibility:** The Form 1 was initially designed to work with Formlabs' proprietary resins. While there were some third-party resins that could be used, experimenting often came with risks and required careful adjustments to print settings.

**Print Quality & Part Characteristics:**

The Form 1 was known for its ability to produce parts with very fine details and smooth surfaces, especially compared to FDM printers of the time. The resolution of the prints was one of the main selling points. Parts printed on the Form 1 have a characteristic smooth, almost glossy, finish after post-curing. This makes them well-suited for applications where aesthetics are important.

**Maintaining the Form 1:**

Regular maintenance is essential for keeping the Form 1 running smoothly. The resin tank needs to be cleaned periodically to remove any debris or cured resin. The laser window must also be cleaned to ensure optimal laser performance. Over time, some components, such as the resin tank film, may need to be replaced.

**Formlabs Form 1: A Detailed Look at Performance (Scores out of 10)**

*   **Print Quality:** 9
*   **Build Volume:** 6 (Limited compared to modern printers)
*   **Printing Speed:** 6 (Relatively slow compared to today's standards)
*   **Material Compatibility:** 4 (Primarily designed for Formlabs resins)
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 7 (Leveling can be tricky, but adhesion is generally good when properly calibrated)
*   **Reliability:** 7 (Good, but susceptible to resin-related issues and component wear)
*   **Ease of Use:** 7 (Software is user-friendly, but the overall process requires some learning)
*   **Firmware and Software:** 8 (PreForm software is well-designed and functional)
*   **Connectivity Options:** 6 (Primarily USB and network connectivity)
*   **Build Quality & Durability:** 8 (Solid construction, but some components are prone to wear)
*   **Noise Level:** 7 (Relatively quiet operation)
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** 6 (Requires regular cleaning and component replacement)
*   **Customer Support:** 7 (Formlabs generally provides good support)
*   **Upgradeability:** 3 (Limited upgrade options)
*   **Price to Performance Ratio:** 7 (Good for its time, but now considered expensive compared to modern printers)

**Average Score:** 6.67 out of 10

**Final Verdict:**

The Formlabs Form 1 was a revolutionary printer that democratized SLA technology. While it may not be the most advanced printer by today's standards, it remains a significant piece of 3D printing history and a testament to the innovation that has driven the industry forward. For those interested in exploring SLA printing on a budget, older used Form 1 machines might be an option but proceed with caution as they will likely need repair and maintenance.
