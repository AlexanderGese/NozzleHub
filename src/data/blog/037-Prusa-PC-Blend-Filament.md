# Prusa PC Blend Filament: A Deep Dive into High-Performance Printing

Polycarbonate (PC) is renowned for its exceptional strength, heat resistance, and impact resistance. The Prusa PC Blend filament aims to bring these advantages to the desktop 3D printing world, offering a compelling option for engineers, designers, and hobbyists seeking parts that can withstand demanding applications. This article provides a comprehensive overview of Prusa PC Blend, focusing on its properties, best practices for printing, and how it stacks up as a 3D printing material.

## What is Prusa PC Blend?

Prusa PC Blend is a polycarbonate-based filament formulated to offer a balance between ease of printing and the desirable mechanical properties of pure PC. It's engineered to be less prone to warping and easier to adhere to the print bed compared to some other PC filaments. This makes it a more accessible option for users without extensive experience with high-temperature materials.

## Detailed Specifications

*   **Material:** Polycarbonate Blend
*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm ± 0.05mm
*   **Print Temperature:** 265-285°C (509-545°F)
*   **Bed Temperature:** 100-115°C (212-239°F)
*   **Nozzle Size:** Recommended 0.4mm or larger
*   **Recommended Print Speed:** 30-50 mm/s (Adjust according to printer capabilities)
*   **Density:** ~1.2 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** Approximately 50-60 MPa (varies with print settings)
*   **Elongation at Break:** Approximately 10-20% (varies with print settings)
*   **Impact Strength (Izod Notched):** Approximately 80-100 J/m (varies with print settings)
*   **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg):** ~110°C
*   **Available Colors:** Typically offered in Black, Natural (Transparent), and often other colors. *Always verify with Prusa Research directly for the current available color range.*
*   **Spool Size:** Usually 1kg

## Key Advantages of Prusa PC Blend

*   **High Strength and Rigidity:** Delivers strong and stiff parts suitable for functional prototypes and end-use components.
*   **Excellent Heat Resistance:** Withstands temperatures up to around 110°C without significant deformation.
*   **Good Impact Resistance:** Can absorb significant impact energy, making it suitable for parts that need to be durable.
*   **Relatively Easy to Print (Compared to Pure PC):** Formulated for improved bed adhesion and reduced warping.
*   **Low Odor:** Compared to some other high-temperature filaments (like ABS), PC Blend produces a relatively mild odor during printing.

## Usage Tips for Successful Printing

Printing with PC Blend requires careful attention to several factors to achieve optimal results.

1.  **Enclosure:** An enclosure is *highly* recommended, if not essential. An enclosure helps maintain a stable ambient temperature around the print, which reduces warping and improves layer adhesion.

2.  **Bed Adhesion:** A heated bed is critical. Use a bed temperature within the recommended range (100-115°C). Adhesion aids like a PEI sheet, glue stick, or special build surface (such as Garolite) are highly recommended to ensure parts stick firmly to the bed.

3.  **Nozzle Temperature:** Maintain a consistent nozzle temperature within the recommended range (265-285°C). The optimal temperature will vary depending on your printer and ambient conditions. Temperature towers can be helpful for calibration.

4.  **Print Speed:** Start with a moderate print speed (30-50 mm/s). Reduce speed for the first layer to improve adhesion. Faster speeds can sometimes lead to warping and poor layer adhesion.

5.  **Layer Height:** Experiment with layer heights. A layer height of 0.15-0.25mm often provides a good balance between print quality and speed.

6.  **Cooling:** Minimize or disable cooling fan usage, especially for the first few layers. Excessive cooling can cause warping and poor layer adhesion.

7.  **Drying:** PC Blend is highly hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store the filament in a sealed container with desiccant when not in use. If the filament has been exposed to moisture, dry it in a filament dryer or oven (at around 70°C for several hours) before printing.  Failure to dry the filament often results in stringing, bubbling, and weak prints.

8.  **Nozzle Considerations:** A hardened steel nozzle is recommended, especially if you plan to print with abrasive materials in the future.  While not strictly *required* for PC Blend, a hardened steel nozzle will resist wear better than brass.

9.  **First Layer Calibration:**  Perfect first layer adhesion is absolutely crucial for PC Blend.  Take your time to calibrate the first layer height precisely.

10. **Brim/Raft:** Consider using a brim or raft to further improve bed adhesion, especially for large or complex parts.

## Filament Evaluation Scores (Out of 10)

*   **Print Quality:** 8 - Can produce excellent quality parts with proper settings.
*   **Toughness:** 9 - Very strong and durable, impact resistant.
*   **Flexibility:** 2 - Highly rigid, very little flex.
*   **Warping:** 6 - Reduced compared to pure PC, but still a potential issue if not managed well.
*   **Adhesion:** 7 - Good with proper preparation, but requires effort.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 2 - Extremely sensitive to moisture.
*   **Color Range:** 6 - Generally offered in a decent, though not expansive, range of colors.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8 - Wide operating temperature once printed.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 7 - Relatively low odor compared to some other engineering filaments.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 9 - Prusa Research is known for excellent filament winding.

**Average Score:** 6.9
