# FILATECH FilaOne ASA: A Deep Dive into High-Performance 3D Printing

Are you looking for a filament that can withstand the rigors of outdoor use and demanding applications? Then you've likely come across ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate). FILATECH, a recognized brand in the 3D printing material space, offers FilaOne ASA, a filament engineered for superior performance. This article provides a detailed look into FILATECH FilaOne ASA, covering its specifications, practical usage tips, and a comprehensive evaluation.

## What is FilaOne ASA?

FilaOne ASA is a high-performance acrylonitrile styrene acrylate filament designed for 3D printing durable and weather-resistant parts. ASA is an alternative to ABS, offering similar mechanical properties with improved UV resistance and reduced yellowing over time. This makes it ideal for parts exposed to sunlight and outdoor conditions. FILATECH’s specific formulation aims to optimize printability and surface finish while maintaining the inherent advantages of ASA.

## FilaOne ASA Specifications:

| **Tensile Strength**    | 40-45 MPa (approximate, varies by printing conditions) |
| **Elongation at Break** | 15-25% (approximate, varies by printing conditions) |
| **Impact Strength**     | Good                                          |
| **Available Colors**    | Varies by supplier, typically includes black, white, natural, grey and other colors. |
| **Spool Weight**        | Typically 750g or 1kg                         |

*Note: These specifications are typical values and can vary based on printing parameters, printer calibration, and specific batch of filament.*

## FilaOne ASA: Usage Tips for Optimal Printing

Successfully printing with ASA requires a slightly different approach compared to PLA. Here are some tips to maximize your chances of success with FilaOne ASA:

*   **Enclosure is Highly Recommended:** ASA is prone to warping due to its higher printing temperature and shrinkage rate. An enclosed printer helps maintain a consistent temperature around the print, minimizing warping and layer separation.
*   **Heated Bed is Essential:** A heated bed with a temperature between 80-100°C is crucial for proper adhesion.
*   **Adhesion Aids:** Use bed adhesion aids such as glue stick, hairspray, or specialized ASA-compatible bed adhesives to further improve adhesion.
*   **Draft Shield or Brim:** Implement a draft shield or brim around the print to provide additional adhesion and minimize warping, especially for parts with sharp corners or large footprints.
*   **Reduce Fan Speed:** Minimize or completely turn off the cooling fan for the first few layers to promote bed adhesion.  After the initial layers, you can gradually increase the fan speed, but generally keep it lower than you would for PLA. Excessive cooling can lead to layer separation and warping.
*   **Print Speed:** A moderate print speed (40-60 mm/s) is recommended for FilaOne ASA to allow for proper layer adhesion and minimize stress on the part.
*   **Proper Storage:** Store FilaOne ASA in a dry environment. Consider using a filament dry box or resealable bag with desiccant packs to prevent moisture absorption, which can lead to printing issues.
*   **Nozzle Temperature:** Start within the recommended range of 230-260°C and adjust as needed based on your printer and specific filament batch.  A slightly higher temperature can improve layer adhesion, but excessive heat can lead to stringing.
*   **First Layer Calibration:** Ensure your first layer is properly calibrated. The nozzle should be close enough to the bed to create a slight squish, ensuring good adhesion.
*   **Ventilation:** While ASA produces less odor than ABS, it's still important to print in a well-ventilated area to minimize exposure to fumes.

## FilaOne ASA: Evaluation & Scoring

Here's a comprehensive rating of FilaOne ASA based on key performance criteria:

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 -  When printed correctly with proper settings and an enclosure, FilaOne ASA can produce smooth, detailed parts. Bridging can be a challenge without optimal cooling control.
*   **Toughness:** 9/10 - ASA offers excellent impact resistance and strength, making it suitable for functional parts.
*   **Flexibility:** 4/10 - ASA is not a flexible material. It is rigid and designed for strength, not bending.
*   **Warping:** 6/10 -  While better than ABS, ASA can still warp, especially with larger prints or inadequate bed adhesion. An enclosure and proper bed preparation are critical.
*   **Adhesion:** 7/10 -  Good bed adhesion can be achieved with the right temperature and bed surface, but it requires careful calibration and often benefits from adhesion aids. Layer adhesion is generally strong when printed at the correct temperature.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 7/10 -  ASA is less hygroscopic than some other filaments like nylon, but it still absorbs moisture over time. Proper storage is essential.
*   **Color Range:** 8/10 - While not as extensive as PLA, FilaOne ASA is available in a decent range of colors from most suppliers.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 - The recommended printing temperature range (230-260°C) provides flexibility for different printer setups.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 6/10 - Produces a noticeable odor during printing, but generally less pungent than ABS.  Adequate ventilation is recommended.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 9/10 -  FILATECH typically provides good spool winding, minimizing the risk of tangles and print failures.

**Average Score: 7.5/10**

## Conclusion

FILATECH FilaOne ASA is a solid choice for users seeking a durable, UV-resistant filament for demanding 3D printing applications. While it requires more attention to printing parameters than PLA, the resulting parts offer excellent mechanical properties and weather resistance. If you need parts for outdoor use or functional prototypes that can withstand higher stress, FilaOne ASA is a worthwhile investment. Remember to utilize the usage tips provided to mitigate warping and achieve optimal print quality.
