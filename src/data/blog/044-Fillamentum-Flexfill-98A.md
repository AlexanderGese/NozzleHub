# Fillamentum Flexfill 98A: A Deep Dive into Flexible 3D Printing

Flexible filaments have revolutionized 3D printing, allowing users to create parts with unique properties, from phone cases to flexible hinges. Among the various options available, Fillamentum Flexfill 98A stands out as a popular choice, known for its balance of flexibility and ease of printing. This article provides an in-depth look at Flexfill 98A, exploring its specifications, usage tips, and overall performance.

## What is Fillamentum Flexfill 98A?

Flexfill 98A is a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filament manufactured by Fillamentum, a renowned filament producer known for its high-quality materials. The "98A" designation refers to the Shore hardness of the filament. A Shore hardness of 98A means it is a relatively firm flexible filament. It's not as soft and rubbery as some other TPUs, but it still offers significant flexibility compared to rigid filaments like PLA or ABS.

## Detailed Specifications:

*   **Material:** Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)
*   **Shore Hardness:** 98A
*   **Diameter:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm (check with supplier)
*   **Density:** 1.16 g/cm³
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 220-240°C (428-464°F)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 50-60°C (122-140°F) - *Heated bed often optional*
*   **Recommended Printing Speed:** 20-40 mm/s (slower speeds often yield better results)
*   **Tolerance:** Typically +/- 0.05mm
*   **Elongation at Break:** ~400%
*   **Tensile Strength:** 30 MPa

## Usage Tips for Optimal Results:

Printing with flexible filaments like Flexfill 98A requires a slightly different approach than printing with rigid materials. Here are some key tips to ensure success:

*   **Direct Drive Extruder:** A direct drive extruder is highly recommended. The shorter filament path minimizes the opportunity for the filament to buckle or twist before entering the hot end. Bowden extruders *can* be used, but require significantly more fine-tuning and slower speeds.
*   **Slow Down!:** Printing speed is crucial. Start with a speed of 20-30 mm/s and adjust as needed. Overly fast printing will almost certainly lead to jams and inconsistent extrusion.
*   **Retraction Settings:** Minimize retraction distance and speed. Excessive retraction can cause the filament to get stuck in the extruder. Experiment to find the optimal balance; some users even disable retraction entirely.
*   **Disable Coasting & Wipe:** Similar to retraction, coasting and wiping features can negatively impact flexible filament printing. Turning them off can improve extrusion consistency.
*   **Extrusion Multiplier/Flow Rate:** Fine-tune your extrusion multiplier (flow rate) to ensure proper layer adhesion. Slightly over-extruding can help the layers bond together, but be careful not to overdo it, as this can lead to clogging.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** Although a heated bed isn't always *required*, it certainly helps. A clean and level bed is essential. Consider using a bed adhesive like a glue stick or hairspray for improved adhesion. PEI sheets often work very well with TPUs.
*   **Nozzle Temperature:** Stay within the recommended temperature range. A slightly higher temperature might improve layer adhesion, but excessive heat can cause the filament to become too soft and lead to jams.
*   **Cooling:** Moderate cooling can be beneficial, but avoid excessive cooling, as it can cause warping. Start with a low fan speed and gradually increase it as needed.
*   **Spool Management:** Keep your filament dry. TPU is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store your filament in an airtight container with desiccant packs when not in use. If you suspect your filament has absorbed moisture, dry it in a filament dryer before printing.
*   **Tension:** Ensure the spool is able to unwind freely. A lot of tension will lead to inconsistent printing.

## Flexfill 98A Performance Evaluation: (Out of 10)

Here's a breakdown of Flexfill 98A's performance in key areas:

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 - With proper settings, excellent detail can be achieved.
*   **Toughness:** 9/10 - Resilient to impacts and wear.
*   **Flexibility:** 7/10 - Not the *most* flexible TPU, but offers a good balance.
*   **Warping:** 9/10 - Minimal warping, especially with a heated bed.
*   **Adhesion:** 8/10 - Good bed adhesion with proper bed preparation.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 5/10 - Relatively high sensitivity; requires careful storage.
*   **Color Range:** 7/10 - Decent range of colors available.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 - Reasonable printing temperature range.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9/10 - Low odor and minimal fumes during printing.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 9/10 - Usually well-wound, preventing tangles.

**Average Score: 7.9/10**

## Conclusion:

Fillamentum Flexfill 98A is a high-quality flexible filament that offers a great balance of printability, toughness, and flexibility. While it requires careful attention to printing settings, the results are well worth the effort. Its durability and resistance to wear make it a solid choice for functional parts, prototypes, and projects that require a degree of flexibility and resilience.
