## eSun PLA Pro (PLA+): A Deep Dive into Enhanced 3D Printing

eSun has consistently been a reliable name in the 3D printing filament world, and their PLA Pro (often referred to as PLA+) is a popular choice for makers looking for something more robust than standard PLA. Let's break down what makes this filament tick, from its specifications to tips for getting the best results.

### What is eSun PLA Pro (PLA+)?

Essentially, PLA Pro is an enhanced version of polylactic acid (PLA). It retains the ease of printing associated with PLA but is formulated to offer improved mechanical properties, specifically in terms of impact resistance, toughness, and overall durability. While still biodegradable under industrial composting conditions, it's designed to create parts that can withstand more stress and wear than standard PLA.

### Detailed Specifications

*   **Material:** Modified Polylactic Acid (PLA)
*   **Diameter:** Typically 1.75mm (±0.05mm) and 2.85mm (±0.05mm) – always confirm with your vendor.
*   **Printing Temperature:** 205-225°C (401-437°F) - This is a broader range than standard PLA due to the modified formulation.
*   **Bed Temperature:** 45-60°C (113-140°F) - Can often be printed successfully without a heated bed.
*   **Density:** 1.24 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** Around 60 MPa (varies with print settings)
*   **Elongation at Break:** 8-10% (significantly better than standard PLA)
*   **Impact Strength:** Improved compared to standard PLA
*   **Spool Weight:** Typically 1kg
*   **Available Colors:** A wide range of colors, including solid, translucent, and specialty effects.

### Usage Tips for Optimal Printing

Getting the most out of eSun PLA Pro requires paying attention to a few key settings and practices:

*   **Temperature Tuning:** While the recommended range is 205-225°C, finding the *sweet spot* for your specific printer is crucial. Start at the lower end (205°C) and increase in 5°C increments until you achieve smooth extrusion and good layer adhesion. Excessive heat can lead to stringing or blobbing.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** PLA Pro generally adheres well to common print surfaces like glass with glue stick, PEI, or BuildTak. Ensuring a level bed is paramount. A brim can be helpful for parts with small contact areas.
*   **Cooling:** Moderate cooling is recommended. Aim for 50-75% fan speed to help the layers solidify without warping.
*   **Print Speed:** A moderate print speed of 40-60 mm/s is generally a good starting point.
*   **Retraction:** Fine-tune your retraction settings to minimize stringing. Experiment with retraction distance and speed. A good starting point would be 6mm at 40mm/s.
*   **Storage:** Like all filaments, PLA Pro is hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air). Store it in an airtight container with desiccant to prevent moisture absorption, which can lead to printing issues.
*   **Post-Processing:** PLA Pro can be sanded, painted, and glued like standard PLA. However, avoid prolonged exposure to high temperatures, as it can soften.

### eSun PLA Pro vs. Similar PLA Filaments (Comparative Focus)

While there are many PLA filaments on the market, let's focus on aspects where eSun PLA Pro distinguishes itself from *standard* PLA formulations, not other brands. The modifications to the PLA formula are the key differences.

*   **Toughness/Impact Resistance:** This is the primary advantage of PLA Pro. Standard PLA is known to be brittle and can easily crack under stress. PLA Pro is formulated to be significantly more impact-resistant, making it suitable for functional parts that need to withstand some abuse.
*   **Flexibility:** While *not* a flexible filament like TPU or TPE, PLA Pro exhibits slightly better flexibility than standard PLA before breaking. It will still snap under significant bending, but can tolerate small deformation.
*   **Warping:** Similar to standard PLA, PLA Pro exhibits very little warping, especially when printed with a heated bed. This makes it easier to print large or intricate parts without worrying about corners lifting.
*   **Odor:** PLA Pro, like standard PLA, has a minimal odor when printing. Some users report a slightly sweet smell, but it is generally considered non-offensive, unlike ABS.
*   **Layer Adhesion:** PLA Pro tends to have excellent layer adhesion, which contributes to the overall strength and durability of printed parts.
*   **Print Quality:** PLA Pro can achieve very high print quality with fine details. It also has a decent matte finish.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**

*   Improved toughness and impact resistance compared to standard PLA.
*   Easy to print, similar to standard PLA.
*   Minimal warping.
*   Low odor.
*   Good layer adhesion.
*   Wide range of colors.
*   Relatively affordable.

**Weaknesses:**

*   Still not as strong or heat-resistant as materials like ABS or PETG.
*   Can be brittle under extreme stress.
*   Moisture-sensitive (requires proper storage).
*   More expensive than standard PLA

### Final Verdict & Scores

Here's a breakdown of eSun PLA Pro based on the criteria you provided, rated out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 9/10 - Achieves excellent detail and smooth surfaces.
*   **Toughness:** 8/10 - Significantly better than standard PLA, but still not industrial grade.
*   **Flexibility:** 5/10 - Offers minimal flex before breaking.
*   **Warping:** 9/10 - Very low warping tendency.
*   **Adhesion:** 9/10 - Excellent bed and layer adhesion.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10 - Requires proper storage to avoid issues.
*   **Color Range:** 9/10 - Offers a wide variety of colors.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 - Broad range allows for flexible settings.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9/10 - Very minimal odor.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8/10 - Generally well-wound, but occasional tangles reported.

**Average Score: 8.0/10**

### Who is eSun PLA Pro For?

eSun PLA Pro is an excellent choice for 3D printing enthusiasts who want to create functional parts that are more durable than standard PLA prints. It's a good option for prototypes, tools, toys, and other objects that need to withstand some level of impact and stress. If you're looking for an easy-to-print filament with improved strength, eSun PLA Pro is a solid choice. However, if your parts require extreme strength, heat resistance, or flexibility, you'll need to explore other filament options.
