# Autodesk Ember: A Deep Dive into High-Resolution Resin Printing

The Autodesk Ember was a foray into the world of desktop 3D printing from the software giant. Designed for high-resolution prints, it leveraged stereolithography (SLA) technology to produce intricate details. While no longer in production, it remains a fascinating example of innovation in the field and worth exploring. This article will explore the Ember's specifications, provide usage tips, and delve into its performance characteristics.

## Ember Specifications:

*   **Technology:** Stereolithography (SLA)
*   **Build Volume:** 64 x 40 x 150 mm (2.5 x 1.6 x 5.9 inches)
*   **Layer Resolution:** 10 - 100 microns
*   **XY Resolution:** 10 microns
*   **Light Source:** Projector with LED
*   **Resin:** Autodesk materials, Open Material Platform
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi, USB
*   **Dimensions:** 330 x 230 x 430 mm (13 x 9 x 17 inches)
*   **Weight:** ~13 kg (29 lbs)
*   **Software:** Autodesk Print Studio

## Understanding the Ember's Strengths:

The Ember distinguished itself with its promise of exceptional detail and a focus on material science. The 10-micron XY resolution, while theoretical, aimed to deliver incredibly smooth surfaces and intricate geometries. The use of a projector-based system, rather than a laser, allowed for faster layer curing. Its Open Material Platform invited collaboration in developing new resins.

## Usage Tips for Ember:

Even though its no longer in production, you could still find it on some sites, so here are some tips and tricks.

*   **Resin Selection is Key:**  Experiment with different resins within the Autodesk ecosystem (or community-developed materials if you are exploring the Open Material Platform). Not all resins perform equally. Focus on properties like tensile strength, elongation, and shrinkage.

*   **Orientation and Supports:** Proper part orientation is crucial in SLA printing. Position your parts to minimize the number of support structures needed, especially on critical surfaces. Use Autodesk Print Studio's support generation tools effectively. Overhanging features will need more support.

*   **Print Settings Fine-Tuning:**  Pay close attention to exposure time per layer. Insufficient exposure leads to weak parts, while overexposure can cause excessive curing and potential warping. Calibrate your resin and printing parameters carefully.

*   **Post-Processing is Essential:** SLA prints require post-processing. This includes washing in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove uncured resin, followed by UV curing to fully harden the part. Invest in a quality UV curing chamber.

*   **Maintenance:** Keep the resin vat clean and free of debris. Regularly inspect the build platform and projector lens for any contamination.

*   **Open Material Platform Considerations:** If using community-developed materials, proceed cautiously. Research the material thoroughly, and start with small test prints to ensure compatibility.

## Autodesk Ember Performance Evaluation:

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 - The Ember was capable of delivering very high detail prints, approaching injection molding quality in the right conditions. However, achieving consistent results required a good understanding of resin properties and careful tuning of print settings.
*   **Build Volume:** 5/10 - The relatively small build volume limited the size of parts that could be produced, but this was standard for desktop SLA printers of its time.
*   **Printing Speed:** 6/10 - The projector-based system allowed for faster curing of each layer compared to some laser-based SLA printers. However, larger parts still required considerable print times.
*   **Material Compatibility:** 6/10 - While designed to work with Autodesk materials, the Open Material Platform allowed for exploration of other resins. This potential comes with inherent risks and requires significant experimentation.
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 7/10 - Bed adhesion was generally reliable with proper preparation and resin selection.
*   **Reliability:** 6/10 -  The Ember had a reputation for requiring more maintenance and fine-tuning than some other 3D printers on the market.
*   **Ease of Use:** 5/10 - Its more difficult to use, so it is recommended for users with more experience.
*   **Firmware and Software:** 7/10 - Autodesk Print Studio provided good control over print settings.
*   **Connectivity Options:** 8/10 - Wi-Fi and USB connectivity.
*   **Build Quality & Durability:** 7/10 - While the Ember was generally well-built, some components were prone to wear and tear.
*   **Noise Level:** 8/10 - Relatively quiet operation.
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** 5/10 -  Regular cleaning of the resin vat and build platform.
*   **Customer Support:** 2/10 - As the Ember is no longer in production, customer support is very limited if it exists at all.
*   **Upgradeability:** 3/10 - The printer has little to no upgradeability.
*   **Price to Performance Ratio:** 4/10 - Considering the limited availability of support and materials, the price-to-performance ratio is low.

**Average Score: 5.6/10**
