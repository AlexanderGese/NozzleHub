## Prusament ASA Galaxy Silver: A Deep Dive into a Stellar Filament

Prusament ASA Galaxy Silver is a high-performance filament known for its robustness, resistance to environmental factors, and distinctive shimmering finish. This article will explore its detailed specifications, offer practical usage tips, and assess its overall performance to help you determine if it's the right choice for your next 3D printing project.

### Unveiling the Galaxy: Specifications

*   **Material:** Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA)
*   **Diameter:** Typically 1.75mm (ensure to check the spool for the actual diameter)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** +/- 0.03mm (indicates high precision and consistent extrusion)
*   **Roundness Tolerance:** +/- 0.02mm (contributes to uniform layer adhesion)
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 240-260°C (check Prusa's website for the most up to date temps)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 90-110°C (critical for proper adhesion, enclosure highly recommended)
*   **Enclosure Recommended:** Yes, crucial for minimizing warping, especially with larger parts.
*   **Nozzle Size:** Compatible with standard 0.4mm nozzles, can be used with larger sizes for faster prints.
*   **Density:** ~1.05 g/cm³ (important for calculating filament usage and print weight)
*   **Tensile Strength:** ~44 MPa (a measure of the material's resistance to stretching before breaking)
*   **Elongation at Break:** ~25% (indicates the material's ability to stretch before fracturing)
*   **Impact Strength (Charpy Notched):** ~18 kJ/m² (measures the material's resistance to impact)
*   **UV Resistance:** Excellent (superior to ABS, making it suitable for outdoor applications)
*   **Chemical Resistance:** Good (resistant to many common chemicals, making it durable in various environments)
*   **Spool Weight:** Typically 1 kg (or 750g in some cases)
*   **Color:** Galaxy Silver (a metallic silver with sparkling flakes)
*   **Finish:** Matte with subtle shimmer due to the embedded particles.

### Printing with Prusament ASA Galaxy Silver: Tips for Success

ASA can be a more challenging material to print with than PLA, but the rewards are significant. Here's a breakdown of the key factors to consider:

*   **Enclosure is Key:**  An enclosure is almost mandatory for successful ASA printing. It helps maintain a stable ambient temperature, preventing warping and cracking, especially with larger prints.  Without an enclosure, expect significant warping and potential print failures.

*   **Bed Adhesion:** A heated bed is essential.  Use a good adhesive such as Magigoo ASA, a PEI sheet with a thin layer of glue stick, or a textured powder-coated sheet specifically designed for ASA.  Clean the bed thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol before each print.  A brim can also help to increase surface area and prevent lifting.

*   **Temperature Control:**  Finding the right printing temperature is crucial. Start within the recommended range (240-260°C) and adjust based on your printer's specific characteristics and the size/complexity of your print. Higher temperatures can improve layer adhesion but may also increase stringing.

*   **Cooling:**  Minimize cooling fan usage. ASA benefits from slow cooling to reduce internal stresses. Use only a small amount of cooling if you encounter bridging issues, but generally aim for minimal fan speed.

*   **Print Speed:**  Start with slower print speeds (e.g., 40-50mm/s) and gradually increase them if your printer can handle it.  Slower speeds can improve layer adhesion and reduce the risk of warping.

*   **Draft Protection:** Avoid drafts in the printing area.  Even small breezes can cause temperature fluctuations and lead to warping.

*   **Filament Storage:** ASA is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store your filament in an airtight container with desiccant to prevent moisture absorption.  If your filament has absorbed moisture, dry it using a filament dryer before printing.  Symptoms of wet filament include popping and hissing during printing, poor layer adhesion, and stringing.

*   **Odor and Ventilation:** ASA emits stronger fumes than PLA. Print in a well-ventilated area or use an enclosure with a filtration system to mitigate the odor.

*   **First Layer Calibration:** A well-calibrated first layer is paramount. Ensure that the nozzle is the correct distance from the bed to achieve optimal adhesion.

### Assessing Prusament ASA Galaxy Silver: Key Metrics

Here's an evaluation of Prusament ASA Galaxy Silver based on key 3D printing characteristics, rated on a scale of 1 to 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 9/10 (Excellent surface finish, detailed prints, especially with proper calibration)
*   **Toughness:** 9/10 (High impact resistance and tensile strength, suitable for functional parts)
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 (Not a flexible material; ASA is rigid)
*   **Warping:** 5/10 (Prone to warping if printed without an enclosure and proper bed adhesion)
*   **Adhesion:** 7/10 (Good adhesion with proper bed preparation and enclosure use)
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10 (More sensitive to moisture than PLA, requires proper storage and drying)
*   **Color Range:** 6/10 (While the Galaxy Silver is visually appealing, the overall ASA color range is more limited compared to PLA.)
*   **Temperature Range:** 7/10 (Requires higher temperatures than PLA, but within a manageable range for most printers.)
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 5/10 (Noticeable odor during printing; ventilation is recommended.)
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 10/10 (Excellent spool winding, minimizing tangles and feeding issues.)

**Average Score: 6.7/10** (Reflects its strengths in print quality, toughness, and spool quality, balanced against its challenges with warping and moisture sensitivity.)

### Conclusion

Prusament ASA Galaxy Silver is a high-quality filament that delivers excellent results when printed correctly. Its superior UV resistance and mechanical properties make it ideal for functional parts and outdoor applications. While it requires more attention to detail during printing than PLA, the resulting prints are durable, visually appealing, and well-suited for demanding environments. If you are willing to invest the time and effort to learn its specific requirements, Prusament ASA Galaxy Silver is a worthwhile addition to your 3D printing arsenal. Remember to focus on proper bed adhesion, enclosure usage, and moisture control for optimal results.
