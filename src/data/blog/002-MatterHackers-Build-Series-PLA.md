# MatterHackers Build Series PLA: A Deep Dive

MatterHackers Build Series PLA has become a staple in many 3D printing enthusiasts' workshops, and for good reason. It's positioned as a reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use filament, perfect for beginners and seasoned makers alike. Let's break down what makes this PLA a solid contender in the crowded filament market.

## Unpacking the Basics: Specifications

Before we dive into performance, let's look at the specifications:

*   **Material:** PLA (Polylactic Acid)
*   **Diameter:** Typically 1.75mm (with tolerances often around +/- 0.05mm)
*   **Spool Size:** Usually 1kg (2.2 lbs)
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 190-220°C (This can vary slightly based on your printer and ambient conditions)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 50-60°C (Though some users find success without a heated bed)
*   **Density:** ~1.24 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** ~50 MPa (This can vary depending on print settings)
*   **Elongation at Break:** ~5% (This can vary depending on print settings)

## Putting it to Work: Usage Tips and Tricks

While Build Series PLA is relatively straightforward to print with, a few tips can drastically improve your results:

*   **Level Your Bed:** A properly leveled bed is crucial for good first-layer adhesion. Take the time to ensure your bed is perfectly level before starting any print.
*   **Fine-Tune Temperature:** The recommended temperature range is a guideline, not a hard-and-fast rule. Experiment within that range to find the sweet spot for your specific printer. If you're seeing stringing, try lowering the temperature slightly. If layers aren't adhering well, try increasing it.
*   **First Layer Adhesion:** Use a brim or raft for parts with small contact areas. A clean build plate is also essential. Isopropyl alcohol is your friend here. For problematic bed adhesion, consider using a glue stick, hairspray, or painter's tape.
*   **Optimize Print Speed:** While PLA is generally forgiving, pushing the limits of your printer's speed can introduce issues. Start with a moderate speed (around 50-60 mm/s) and adjust from there.
*   **Keep it Dry:** PLA is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. This can lead to brittle prints, stringing, and bubbling during printing. Store your filament in an airtight container with desiccant packs when not in use. If you suspect your filament has absorbed moisture, consider drying it in a filament dryer or a low-temperature oven.
*   **Cooling is Key:** PLA benefits greatly from cooling. Ensure your printer's cooling fan is running at a decent speed to help layers solidify quickly and prevent warping.

## How it Stacks Up: Performance Metrics Breakdown

Let's evaluate MatterHackers Build Series PLA based on key performance criteria:

*   **Print Quality (8/10):** This filament consistently produces smooth, detailed prints with minimal imperfections when printing parameters are dialed in. It might not achieve the super-fine detail of some higher-end PLAs, but it's more than adequate for most applications.
*   **Toughness (6/10):** Standard PLA isn't known for its toughness. While Build Series PLA is reasonably strong, it's not ideal for parts that will be subjected to significant stress or impact. Consider other filaments like PETG or ABS for those applications.
*   **Flexibility (3/10):** PLA is inherently rigid. Build Series PLA offers very little flexibility.
*   **Warping (9/10):** PLA is less prone to warping than materials like ABS. Build Series PLA exhibits minimal warping, even on larger prints, particularly when using a heated bed and proper cooling.
*   **Adhesion (8/10):** Excellent adhesion to a variety of build surfaces. A clean, leveled bed, and a bit of bed adhesive (if needed) are usually enough to achieve solid first-layer adhesion.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity (7/10):** PLA is susceptible to moisture absorption, which can degrade print quality. While not the worst offender, it's still important to store Build Series PLA properly.
*   **Color Range (9/10):** MatterHackers offers Build Series PLA in a wide array of colors, from basic shades to vibrant and unique options. This variety allows for creative expression in your prints.
*   **Temperature Range (8/10):** The recommended temperature range of 190-220°C is fairly standard for PLA, making it compatible with a wide range of printers.
*   **Odor & Fumes (9/10):** PLA is known for having a minimal odor during printing. Build Series PLA is no exception, emitting a faint, sweet smell that is generally considered pleasant and not harmful.
*   **Spool Winding Quality (8/10):** Tidy spool winding is crucial to prevent tangles and print failures. MatterHackers typically does a good job of winding their spools, minimizing the risk of issues.

## Overall Score

**Average Score: 7.5/10**

MatterHackers Build Series PLA is a solid, reliable, and affordable filament that's easy to recommend for a wide range of 3D printing projects. Its strengths lie in its print quality, minimal warping, and ease of use. While it may not be the toughest or most flexible material, its overall performance and value make it a great choice for both beginners and experienced users.
