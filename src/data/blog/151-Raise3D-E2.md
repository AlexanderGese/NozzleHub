# Raise3D E2: A Deep Dive into This Independent Dual Extrusion 3D Printer

The Raise3D E2 is a professional-grade 3D printer designed for serious users and small businesses seeking reliable and high-quality prints with a focus on independent dual extrusion (IDEX) capabilities. This machine isn't about flashy gimmicks; it's about consistent performance, robust build quality, and the ability to handle a wide range of materials. Let's break down what makes the E2 tick and whether it's the right choice for your needs.

## Usage Tips and Best Practices:

The E2 is a powerful machine, but like any tool, it performs best with proper usage. Here are some tips to maximize your printing success:

*   **Bed Leveling is Key:** The E2 has an assisted bed leveling system, but ensure you run it regularly. A perfectly level bed is crucial for first-layer adhesion, especially with demanding materials like ABS or PC. Pay close attention to the Z-offset calibration after leveling, as this is vital for the first layer to properly adhere.
*   **Master ideaMaker:** Raise3D's ideaMaker slicing software is tailored for the E2 and offers advanced control over print settings. Take the time to learn its features, including retraction settings, temperature controls, and support generation options. Experiment with different profiles to optimize for specific materials.
*   **Filament Storage:** Moisture is the enemy of many 3D printing filaments. Store your filaments in airtight containers with desiccant packs to prevent them from absorbing moisture, which can lead to printing issues like stringing, bubbling, and poor layer adhesion.
*   **IDEX Calibration:** When using the IDEX functionality (Mirror Mode, Duplicate Mode, or Support Mode), ensure the extruders are properly aligned. ideaMaker offers calibration tools to fine-tune the alignment and prevent collisions between the nozzles.
*   **Material Selection:** While the E2 can handle a wide range of materials, not all materials are created equal. Research the properties of each filament and choose the right material for your specific application. Refer to Raise3D's recommended settings as a starting point.
*   **Regular Maintenance:** Keep the printer clean and lubricated. Regularly clean the nozzles, inspect the belts and pulleys, and apply lubricant to the Z-axis lead screws. This will ensure smooth operation and extend the lifespan of your printer.
*   **Temperature Management:** Different filaments require different temperature settings. Experiment with nozzle and bed temperatures to find the optimal settings for each material. Enclosure temperature can also play a significant role in the success of printing temperature-sensitive materials like ABS or Polycarbonate. Consider building an enclosure if you are printing these types of filaments frequently.

## Comprehensive Rating:

Here's a breakdown of the Raise3D E2's performance in various categories, rated out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 9/10 - Excellent detail and accuracy, consistent results across a range of materials. Minor tuning may be required for optimal performance with some exotic filaments.
*   **Build Volume:** 7/10 - The build volume is adequate for most projects, but not the largest in its class. Suitable for prototyping and small-scale production.
*   **Printing Speed:** 8/10 - Capable of reaching decent printing speeds without sacrificing quality. Can be further optimized with proper tuning.
*   **Material Compatibility:** 9/10 - Supports a very wide range of materials, including engineering-grade plastics and composites. Requires proper temperature control and ventilation.
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 8/10 - The assisted bed leveling system works well, but manual fine-tuning may be necessary for some materials. Adhesion is generally good with proper bed preparation.
*   **Reliability:** 9/10 - The E2 is built to last, with a robust construction and reliable components. Less prone to breakdowns and requires less maintenance compared to similar printers.
*   **Ease of Use:** 7/10 - The touchscreen interface is intuitive, and the software is user-friendly. However, achieving optimal results requires some knowledge of 3D printing principles.
*   **Firmware and Software:** 8/10 - ideaMaker is a powerful and well-supported slicing software that is designed specifically for Raise3D printers. Firmware updates are released regularly to improve performance and add new features.
*   **Connectivity Options:** 8/10 - Offers a variety of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and USB. Allows for remote monitoring and control of the printer.
*   **Build Quality & Durability:** 9/10 - High-quality construction with durable components. The printer feels solid and well-engineered.
*   **Noise Level:** 6/10 - The E2 is not the quietest printer on the market. Noise levels can be reduced with proper dampening.
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** 7/10 - Requires regular cleaning and lubrication, but overall maintenance is relatively simple.
*   **Customer Support:** 8/10 - Raise3D offers responsive and helpful customer support through various channels.
*   **Upgradeability:** 6/10 - Limited upgrade options, but the printer is well-equipped out of the box.
*   **Price to Performance Ratio:** 7/10 - The E2 is a premium 3D printer with a higher price tag. However, it offers excellent performance and reliability for professional users.

**Average Score:** 7.73/10
