### TAZ Pro Usage Tips for Optimal Results

Getting the most out of your TAZ Pro involves a few key considerations:

*   **Leveling is Key:** While the TAZ Pro has automatic bed leveling, occasionally double-checking and manually adjusting the bed can improve first layer adhesion, especially when working with tricky materials.
*   **Temperature Tuning:** Every filament is different. Experiment with temperature settings (both nozzle and bed) to find the sweet spot for each material. Start with the manufacturer's recommendations and adjust incrementally.
*   **Enclosure Considerations:** For materials like ABS and Nylon, an enclosure can significantly improve print quality by reducing warping and cracking. While the TAZ Pro doesn't come with an enclosure, aftermarket options are available.
*   **Proper Slicing is Crucial:** Familiarize yourself with Cura LulzBot Edition. Understanding its settings and how they affect print quality will allow you to optimize your prints for strength, speed, and aesthetics.
*   **Maintenance Matters:** Regular cleaning, lubrication, and inspections will keep your TAZ Pro running smoothly for years to come. Don't neglect these tasks!
*   **Material Drying:** Make sure that the used filament doesn't have moisture in it, as this will ruin the printing process.
