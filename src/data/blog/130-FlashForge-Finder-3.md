# FlashForge Finder 3: Your Entry Point into 3D Printing

The FlashForge Finder 3 aims to be a user-friendly and reliable entry point into the world of 3D printing. Designed with beginners in mind, it boasts a sleek design, enclosed build chamber, and simple operation. But does it live up to its promise? Let's delve into the details.

## FlashForge Finder 3: A Detailed Look

The Finder 3 is a desktop Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printer, utilizing a heated bed to melt and deposit thermoplastic filament layer by layer to create three-dimensional objects.

### Detailed Specifications:

*   **Printing Technology:** Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
*   **Build Volume:** 190 x 110 x 180 mm (7.5 x 4.3 x 7.1 inches)
*   **Layer Resolution:** 50-400 microns (0.05 - 0.4mm)
*   **Filament Diameter:** 1.75 mm
*   **Nozzle Diameter:** 0.4 mm
*   **Maximum Nozzle Temperature:** 240°C (464°F)
*   **Maximum Bed Temperature:** 110°C (230°F)
*   **Print Speed:** 10-100 mm/s (recommended: 40-60 mm/s)
*   **Supported Materials:** PLA, PETG, TPU
*   **Connectivity:** USB drive, Wi-Fi
*   **Software:** FlashPrint (proprietary), compatible with other slicing software
*   **Operating System:** Linux
*   **Touch Screen:** 3.5-inch color touchscreen
*   **Power Supply:** 100-240V AC, 50/60Hz
*   **Dimensions:** 408 x 426 x 415 mm (16 x 16.8 x 16.3 inches)
*   **Weight:** 11 kg (24.2 lbs)
*   **Leveling:** Automatic Leveling

### Usage Tips & Best Practices:

*   **Filament Storage:** Keep your filament dry. Moisture absorption is the enemy of good prints. Store it in an airtight container with desiccant. Even leaving the filament out overnight can ruin the material.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** While the heated bed helps, consider using a bed adhesive like glue stick or hairspray, especially for materials like ABS that are prone to warping. I have had much success with using glue sticks for PLA and hairspray for PETG.
*   **Leveling is Key:** Even with automatic leveling, it's a good idea to double-check the bed leveling before starting a print. A slightly unlevel bed can cause prints to fail, especially on the first layer. The paper method is helpful here.
*   **Temperature Settings:** Experiment with temperature settings. The recommended temperature for PLA is between 190-220°C, but every filament is different. Slight adjustments can dramatically affect print quality.
*   **Print Speed:** Slower print speeds generally result in better print quality, especially for complex geometries.
*   **Slicing Software:** The included FlashPrint software is good for beginners, but consider exploring other options like Cura or Simplify3D for more advanced control over print settings.
*   **First Layer is Crucial:** Pay close attention to the first layer. If it's not sticking well or is uneven, stop the print and adjust the bed leveling or nozzle height.
*   **Use Rafts or Brims:** For prints with small contact areas, use a raft or brim to improve bed adhesion and prevent warping.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Common issues include nozzle clogs, filament jams, and bed adhesion problems. Consult online forums and the FlashForge documentation for troubleshooting tips.
*   **Ventilation:** While PLA is relatively non-toxic, ensure adequate ventilation in your printing area.

## FlashForge Finder 3: Breakdown and Final Score

Here's a breakdown of the FlashForge Finder 3 across various categories, rated out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 7/10 (Good for beginners, but not professional-grade)
*   **Build Volume:** 6/10 (Sufficient for most small projects, but limiting for larger prints)
*   **Printing Speed:** 7/10 (Capable, but not the fastest printer available)
*   **Material Compatibility:** 6/10 (Limited to PLA, PETG, TPU, requiring more research for ABS)
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 8/10 (Automatic leveling is a plus, heated bed helpful, glue still recommended)
*   **Reliability:** 7/10 (Generally reliable, but occasional hiccups may occur)
*   **Ease of Use:** 9/10 (Excellent for beginners, intuitive interface)
*   **Firmware and Software:** 7/10 (FlashPrint is user-friendly, but lacks advanced features)
*   **Connectivity Options:** 7/10 (USB and Wi-Fi offer flexibility)
*   **Build Quality & Durability:** 7/10 (Decent build quality, but some plastic components)
*   **Noise Level:** 8/10 (Relatively quiet operation)
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** 8/10 (Low maintenance)
*   **Customer Support:** 6/10 (Varies, depending on region)
*   **Upgradeability:** 5/10 (Limited upgrade options)
*   **Price to Performance Ratio:** 8/10 (Good value for the price)

**Average Score:** 7.13/10

**Conclusion:**

The FlashForge Finder 3 is a solid choice for beginners looking for an easy-to-use and reliable 3D printer. Its automatic leveling, heated bed, and enclosed build chamber make it a forgiving platform for learning the ropes of 3D printing. While it has limitations in terms of build volume and material compatibility, it offers excellent value for its price. For experienced users, more advanced printers might be preferable. But for newcomers, the Finder 3 is a fantastic stepping stone into the 3D printing world.
