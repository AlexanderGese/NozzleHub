# Prusament ASA Anthracite Grey: A Deep Dive

ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) is steadily gaining popularity in the 3D printing world, offering a robust alternative to ABS with improved UV resistance and less warping. Prusament's ASA Anthracite Grey is a filament that promises reliability and quality, backing the reputation of the Prusa brand. Let's take a closer look.

## Specifications

*   **Material:** Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA)
*   **Color:** Anthracite Grey (A deep, dark grey, approaching black)
*   **Diameter:** Typically 1.75mm (Prusament is known for its tight tolerances)
*   **Recommended Nozzle Temperature:** 250-260°C
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 80-100°C
*   **Density:** ~1.07 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** ~42 MPa
*   **Elongation at Break:** ~20%
*   **Spool Size:** Typically 1kg
*   **Spool Material:** Cardboard (environmentally friendly)

## Understanding ASA: Key Advantages

ASA excels in applications where parts will be exposed to the elements. Its key strengths lie in:

*   **UV Resistance:** Far superior to ABS, meaning parts won't yellow or become brittle when exposed to sunlight.
*   **High Impact Strength:** ASA offers good impact resistance, making it suitable for functional parts.
*   **Temperature Resistance:** ASA can withstand higher temperatures compared to PLA.
*   **Dimensional Stability:** ASA exhibits less warping than ABS, although it's still a factor to consider.

## Usage Tips for Prusament ASA Anthracite Grey

Successfully printing with ASA requires careful attention to detail. Here are some tips to maximize your results:

1.  **Enclosure is Highly Recommended:** An enclosure helps maintain a consistent temperature around the print, significantly reducing warping and layer separation.
2.  **Bed Adhesion:** ASA needs excellent bed adhesion. Consider using a brim, raft, or adhesive like Magigoo or a diluted PVA glue stick. Textured PEI sheets often work well. A clean bed is crucial. Wipe it down with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) before each print.
3.  **First Layer is Key:** Ensure your first layer is dialed in perfectly. Too close, and you'll get elephant's foot; too far, and you'll have adhesion issues.
4.  **Print Speed:** Reduce your print speed, especially for the first few layers. This allows the material to adhere properly and reduces stress.
5.  **Cooling:** Minimal cooling is generally recommended. Too much cooling can lead to warping. Consider turning off the fan for the first few layers and then using a low fan speed (10-20%) for the remainder of the print.
6.  **Ventilation:** ASA emits fumes during printing, so ensure adequate ventilation in your workspace.
7.  **Dry Filament is Essential:** ASA is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store your filament in a dry box with desiccant when not in use. If you suspect your filament has absorbed moisture, dry it in a filament dryer or oven (at a low temperature, around 45-50°C) before printing.
8.  **Seam Placement:** Experiment with seam placement to minimize its visibility.
9.  **Support Settings:** Use appropriate support settings. Support interface layers can help with easy removal and a smoother surface finish.
10. **Consider a Draft Shield:** A draft shield (a single-layer wall around your part) can help further reduce warping, especially for larger prints.
11. **Surface Finishing:** ASA can be sanded, painted, and vapor smoothed (using acetone, although this requires caution and proper ventilation).

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

*   **Warping:** The most common issue. Address this by using an enclosure, a heated bed, improved bed adhesion, reduced cooling, and a slower print speed.
*   **Layer Separation (Delamination):** Caused by insufficient bed adhesion, incorrect temperature settings, or drafts. Ensure your bed is clean, your temperature is correct, and your enclosure is maintaining a consistent temperature.
*   **Stringing:** Caused by excessive nozzle temperature or retraction settings that are too low. Reduce nozzle temperature or increase retraction.
*   **Clogging:** Often due to moisture in the filament or incorrect temperature settings. Dry your filament and ensure your nozzle temperature is appropriate.
*   **Elephant's Foot:** Caused by the first layer being too close to the bed. Adjust your Z-offset.

## Prusament ASA Anthracite Grey Filament Rating:

Here's a breakdown of Prusament ASA Anthracite Grey filament rated out of 10, based on common user experience:

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 - With proper settings, excellent surface finish and detail can be achieved.
*   **Toughness:** 9/10 - ASA is known for its high impact resistance.
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 - ASA is not a flexible material; it is rigid.
*   **Warping:** 6/10 - Better than ABS, but still requires careful attention.
*   **Adhesion:** 7/10 - Good adhesion to the bed with proper preparation.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 7/10 - Requires proper storage to prevent moisture absorption.
*   **Color Range:** 5/10 - As a single color filament, color range isn't a factor, but the Anthracite Grey is a versatile shade.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 - A wide temperature range is needed, but ASA can withstand elevated temperatures.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 6/10 - Produces noticeable fumes; ventilation is necessary.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 10/10 - Prusament is known for excellent spool winding.

**Average Score:** 7.2/10
