### Unpacking and Initial Setup

Setting up the MK4 is designed to be straightforward. The kit comes with everything you need, neatly organized.

1.  **Assembly (If Applicable):** The MK4 is available both as a kit and fully assembled. If you opt for the kit, follow the detailed, step-by-step instructions (online and in print). Take your time and double-check each step. A well-assembled printer is crucial for optimal performance.
2.  **Connecting the Electronics:** Once the frame is assembled, connect all the electronic components according to the manual.
3.  **Initial Calibration:** Power on the printer and follow the on-screen prompts for the initial calibration. This process involves bed leveling and Z-offset adjustment.
4.  **First Print:** Use the pre-loaded g-code files on the included SD card to test the printer. Choose a simple print like the Prusa logo or a calibration cube.

### Usage Tips and Best Practices

To maximize the performance and lifespan of your MK4, consider these tips:

*   **Bed Adhesion:** Ensure the print bed is clean. Use isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove any grease or residue. For challenging materials like ABS or nylon, consider using a brim or raft for better adhesion.
*   **Filament Management:** Store filaments in airtight containers with desiccant to prevent moisture absorption. This is especially crucial for materials like nylon and PETG.
*   **Slicing Software:** PrusaSlicer is the recommended slicing software for the MK4. It's tightly integrated with the printer and provides optimized profiles for a wide range of materials. Experiment with different settings to fine-tune print quality and speed.
*   **Regular Maintenance:** Clean the nozzle regularly to prevent clogs. Lubricate the lead screws and bearings periodically.
*   **Firmware Updates:** Keep the firmware up to date. Prusa Research regularly releases updates with new features and bug fixes.
*   **Print Speed:** While the MK4 boasts improved print speeds, don't push it too far initially. Start with conservative speeds and gradually increase them as you become more comfortable with the printer.
*   **Proper Ventilation:** When printing materials like ABS or ASA, ensure adequate ventilation to avoid inhaling harmful fumes.

### Material Compatibility

The MK4 is compatible with a wide array of filaments. However, some materials require specific settings and precautions:

*   **PLA:** Easy to print, ideal for beginners.
*   **PETG:** Stronger than PLA, more heat-resistant.
*   **ABS:** Durable and heat-resistant, but requires a heated enclosure to prevent warping.
*   **ASA:** Similar to ABS, but more UV-resistant.
*   **TPU:** Flexible and elastic. Requires careful tuning of print speed and retraction settings.
*   **Nylon:** Strong and wear-resistant, but highly hygroscopic (absorbs moisture). Requires drying before printing.
*   **Polycarbonate (PC):** High strength and heat resistance, but requires high printing temperatures and a heated enclosure.
*   **Carbon Fiber Composites:** These materials are abrasive and require a hardened steel nozzle.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Poor Bed Adhesion:** Clean the bed thoroughly with IPA. Adjust the Z-offset. Use a brim or raft.
*   **Warping:** Print ABS or ASA in an enclosure. Increase bed temperature. Use a brim or raft.
*   **Clogging:** Clean the nozzle. Increase printing temperature. Check for debris in the filament path.
*   **Layer Shifting:** Check belt tension. Ensure the printer is stable and not vibrating excessively.
