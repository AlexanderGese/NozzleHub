**Usage Tips and Best Practices:**

Getting the most out of the Titan 2 HR requires a good understanding of resin printing principles and some specific tips tailored to this machine:

1.  **Resin Selection:** The Titan 2 HR offers excellent resin compatibility. Start with the resin manufacturer's recommended settings, but be prepared to experiment. Different resins will require fine-tuning of exposure times, lift speeds, and retraction settings. Keep a detailed log of your successful settings for each resin type you use.

2.  **Orientation and Support Generation:** Proper orientation is crucial for minimizing support structures and ensuring print success. Aim for orientations that reduce large cross-sectional areas on each layer, as this can lead to warping or print failures. Use Kudo3D Composer or a third-party slicer with advanced support generation features. Pay attention to support thickness and density, especially for delicate features.

3.  **Bed Leveling:** Leveling the build platform is essential. The Titan 2 HR includes a manual leveling system. Take your time during the initial setup to ensure the platform is perfectly aligned. Check the leveling periodically, especially after transporting the printer.

4.  **Environmental Control:** Resin printing is sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Ideally, operate the printer in a temperature-controlled environment between 20-25°C (68-77°F). Extreme temperatures can affect resin viscosity and cure rates.

5.  **Resin Management:** Store resins in airtight containers away from direct sunlight. Filter the resin in the vat after each print to remove any cured particles or debris. Regularly clean the resin vat and the build platform with isopropyl alcohol (IPA).

6.  **Post-Processing:** Post-processing is a critical step in resin printing. After printing, carefully remove the print from the build platform. Wash the print in IPA to remove uncured resin. Cure the print under UV light to achieve its final hardness and mechanical properties. Remove support structures after washing, but before final curing, for easier removal and cleaner results.

7.  **Software Workflow:** The Kudo3D Composer software is specifically designed for the Titan 2 HR. Familiarize yourself with its features, including orientation tools, support generation, hollowing options, and print parameter settings. Explore advanced slicing techniques to optimize print quality and minimize resin consumption.

8.  **Troubleshooting:** Keep a detailed log of your prints, including settings, resin type, and any issues encountered. This will help you identify patterns and troubleshoot problems more effectively. Common issues include print failures due to insufficient exposure, warping due to improper orientation, and support structure failures.
