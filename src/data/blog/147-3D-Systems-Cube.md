## The 3D Systems Cube: A Deep Dive into a Pioneer

The 3D Systems Cube, a name synonymous with early consumer 3D printing, holds a unique place in the history of desktop fabrication. While no longer in production, understanding its capabilities and limitations offers valuable insight into the evolution of 3D printing technology. This article provides an in-depth look at the Cube, focusing on its specifications, practical usage, and overall strengths and weaknesses.

### 3D Systems Cube: Core Specifications

Let's start with the fundamental specifications that defined the 3D Systems Cube:

*   **Technology:** Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), also known as Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)
*   **Build Volume:** 5.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 inches (140 x 140 x 140 mm)
*   **Layer Resolution:** 0.2 mm (200 microns)
*   **Filament Diameter:** Proprietary Cartridges
*   **Materials:** PLA and ABS Plastic (Proprietary)
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi, USB
*   **Software:** Cubify Invent (No longer officially supported, but compatible alternatives exist)
*   **Dimensions:** 10 x 10 x 13.5 inches (254 x 254 x 343 mm)
*   **Weight:** 17 lbs (7.7 kg)
*   **Power Supply:** 110/240V AC

### Practical Usage Tips & Considerations

Using the Cube effectively requires understanding its quirks. Here's some advice based on user experience:

*   **Cartridge Dependency:** The Cube's biggest limitation is its reliance on proprietary cartridges. This restricts material choices and often leads to higher filament costs. While 3rd party solutions exist, they come with their own challenges.
*   **Bed Leveling:** The Cube features an automatic bed leveling system. However, it sometimes requires manual intervention. Ensure the nozzle is properly calibrated to the bed for optimal adhesion.
*   **Adhesion:** Using a raft is recommended for many prints, especially those with small footprints. Experiment with blue painter's tape or other adhesion aids for improved first-layer performance.
*   **Software Compatibility:** The original Cubify Invent software is no longer officially supported. Users can explore alternative slicing software like Cura or Simplify3D, but compatibility may require some tweaking of settings.
*   **Maintenance:** Regular cleaning of the nozzle is crucial to prevent clogging. Also, lubricate moving parts as needed to ensure smooth operation.
*   **Filament Storage:** Proper filament storage is important. Store the cartridges in airtight containers with desiccant to prevent moisture absorption, especially for PLA.

### Evaluation of the 3D Systems Cube

Here's a breakdown of the Cube's performance across key criteria, graded on a scale of 1 to 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 6/10 - While capable of decent prints, the 200-micron resolution and material limitations restrict fine detail and surface finish.
*   **Build Volume:** 5/10 - The relatively small build volume limits the size of objects that can be printed.
*   **Printing Speed:** 5/10 - Print speeds are generally slower compared to modern printers.
*   **Material Compatibility:** 2/10 - Severely limited by proprietary cartridges, restricting material choice to PLA and ABS from 3D Systems.
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 6/10 - The auto-leveling system is convenient but can sometimes be inconsistent.
*   **Reliability:** 5/10 - Prone to issues such as nozzle clogs and cartridge recognition problems.
*   **Ease of Use:** 7/10 - Relatively user-friendly for beginners, especially with the original software, though alternatives may require more technical knowledge.
*   **Firmware and Software:** 4/10 - Original software is outdated, and compatibility with modern slicers can be challenging.
*   **Connectivity Options:** 6/10 - Wi-Fi and USB connectivity provide basic options for transferring files.
*   **Build Quality & Durability:** 7/10 - The printer is relatively sturdy and well-built for its time.
*   **Noise Level:** 6/10 - Produces a moderate level of noise during operation.
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** 5/10 - Regular cleaning and maintenance are necessary to prevent issues.
*   **Customer Support:** 1/10 - Official customer support is no longer available, which necessitates relying on online communities for troubleshooting.
*   **Upgradeability:** 2/10 - Limited upgrade options due to its proprietary design.
*   **Price to Performance Ratio:** 4/10 - While initially affordable, the ongoing cost of cartridges makes it less competitive compared to more modern open-source printers.

**Average Score:** 4.73/10

### Conclusion

The 3D Systems Cube was a significant step in bringing 3D printing to consumers. However, its proprietary ecosystem, limited material options, and dated technology ultimately hinder its appeal today. While it might be a decent entry point for learning the basics if obtained at a very low price, newer, more versatile, and open-source printers offer a much better value proposition.
