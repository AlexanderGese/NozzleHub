## Taulman 645 Nylon: A Deep Dive into a High-Performance Filament

Taulman 645 Nylon is a renowned filament in the 3D printing community, lauded for its strength, durability, and resistance to chemicals. This article explores the intricacies of 645 Nylon, providing you with the information needed to successfully print with it.

**What is Taulman 645 Nylon?**

Taulman 645 is a specific type of Nylon 6/6 copolymer. It’s designed to be more user-friendly than some other nylon filaments, particularly concerning bed adhesion and warping. It boasts impressive tensile strength, making it suitable for functional parts and applications where durability is paramount.

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Material:** Nylon 6/6 copolymer
*   **Diameter:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm (check your supplier)
*   **Tensile Strength:** ~7,500 PSI
*   **Elongation at Break:** ~200%
*   **Heat Deflection Temperature (HDT):** ~121°C (250°F)
*   **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg):** ~65°C (149°F)
*   **Printing Temperature:** 235-260°C (455-500°F) - Dial in for optimal results
*   **Bed Temperature:** 70-80°C (158-176°F)
*   **Nozzle Type:** Hardened Steel recommended (abrasive)
*   **Recommended Print Speed:** 30-60 mm/s (adjust for optimal results)

**Usage Tips for Taulman 645:**

Printing with nylon can be a bit more challenging than materials like PLA. Here's a breakdown of tips for a successful 645 Nylon experience:

*   **Drying is Crucial:** Nylon is hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air.  This moisture *significantly* degrades print quality, causing stringing, bubbling, and weakened parts. **Always** dry your filament before printing and keep it dry during printing. Use a filament dryer or a low-temperature oven (around 60°C / 140°F) for several hours.
*   **Storage:** Store your 645 Nylon in an airtight container with desiccant packets to minimize moisture absorption.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** Achieving good bed adhesion is key. Here are some common strategies:
    *   **Heated Bed:** Essential. Aim for 70-80°C.
    *   **Adhesion Aids:** PEI sheets are often effective.  Other options include specialized nylon adhesives (like Magigoo Pro PA). A thin layer of glue stick can also work, though less consistently.
    *   **First Layer Settings:** Reduce your first layer print speed and slightly increase the first layer flow rate to ensure proper squish.
*   **Enclosure (Recommended):** An enclosure helps to maintain a consistent ambient temperature, reducing warping and improving layer adhesion. If you don't have a dedicated enclosure, a cardboard box can work in a pinch.
*   **Nozzle Choice:** Nylon filaments are mildly abrasive. While you can print with a brass nozzle, a hardened steel nozzle will resist wear and tear, especially for long-term use.
*   **Print Speed:** Start with a moderate print speed (30-60mm/s) and adjust as needed.  Slower speeds generally improve layer adhesion and reduce warping.
*   **Cooling:** Minimize cooling fan usage. Nylon generally benefits from minimal to no cooling, as it can exacerbate warping. Adjust based on the complexity of the print; small details might require a slight fan speed increase.
*   **Layer Height:** Generally, layer heights between 0.1mm and 0.3mm work well with 645 Nylon. Adjust to suit your desired print resolution and strength requirements.
*   **Flow Rate:** Calibrate your flow rate for optimal results. Over-extrusion can lead to dimensional inaccuracies and a rough surface finish.
*   **Ventilation:** While 645 Nylon doesn't produce particularly harmful fumes, printing in a well-ventilated area is always recommended.
*   **Stringing:** If you experience stringing, try the following:
    *   Increase retraction distance and speed.
    *   Lower the printing temperature in small increments.
    *   Ensure your filament is properly dried.

**Evaluation of Taulman 645 Nylon (Out of 10):**

*   **Print Quality:** 8 - Can achieve excellent results with proper settings and drying.
*   **Toughness:** 9 - Very strong and durable material.
*   **Flexibility:** 6 - Moderate flexibility; not as flexible as some other nylon formulations.
*   **Warping:** 7 - Less prone to warping than some other nylons, but still requires careful attention to bed adhesion and temperature control.
*   **Adhesion:** 7 - Requires a heated bed and often an adhesion aid.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 3 - Highly hygroscopic; requires careful storage and drying.
*   **Color Range:** 4 - Typically available in a limited color palette (natural/translucent, black).
*   **Temperature Range:** 8 - Good heat resistance for functional parts.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 6 - Mild odor, proper ventilation recommended.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 9 - Generally well-wound spools.

**Average Score:** 7.4
