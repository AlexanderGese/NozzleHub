# Conquer Complexity: A Deep Dive into NinjaTek NinjaFlex 3D Printing Filament

For 3D printing enthusiasts eager to push the boundaries of what's possible, flexible filaments offer a gateway to creating functional, durable, and incredibly versatile parts.  Among these, NinjaTek NinjaFlex stands out as a top contender. This article dives deep into NinjaFlex, exploring its specifications, offering practical usage tips, and providing a frank assessment of its strengths and weaknesses.

## What is NinjaTek NinjaFlex?

NinjaFlex isn't your average 3D printing filament. It's a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filament renowned for its exceptional flexibility and durability.  This makes it ideal for creating parts that need to bend, compress, absorb impact, or act as seals and gaskets. Imagine printing phone cases, flexible hinges, tire treads for RC cars, or even wearable technology – NinjaFlex makes it feasible.

## NinjaFlex Specifications:

*   **Material:** Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)
*   **Shore Hardness:** 85A (This indicates a relatively soft and pliable material)
*   **Diameter:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm (ensure compatibility with your printer)
*   **Density:** Approximately 1.19 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** 6 MPa (relatively low, reflecting its flexibility)
*   **Elongation at Break:** 660% (This demonstrates its incredible stretching ability)
*   **Printing Temperature:** 225-235°C (This is a general range and can vary slightly)
*   **Bed Temperature:** 30-60°C (Heated bed recommended for optimal adhesion)
*   **Nozzle Size:** 0.4mm or larger recommended
*   **Print Speed:** 15-30 mm/s (Slower speeds are generally preferred)

## Mastering the Art of Printing with NinjaFlex: Usage Tips

Printing with flexible filaments like NinjaFlex can be a bit more challenging than printing with rigid materials like PLA or ABS. Here's a guide to help you achieve successful prints:

*   **Printer Setup is Key:**
    *   **Direct Drive Extruder:** A direct drive extruder (where the extruder motor is directly above the hot end) is HIGHLY recommended. This minimizes the distance the filament needs to travel, reducing the risk of buckling or wrapping.  Bowden setups can work, but require meticulous tuning and are generally less reliable.
    *   **Constrained Filament Path:** Ensure your printer's filament path is as constrained as possible. Any gaps or spaces in the extruder mechanism can allow the flexible filament to escape and cause jams. Consider using a guide tube to further support the filament.
    *   **Slow and Steady Wins the Race:**  Printing speed is crucial.  Start with a very slow speed (15-20mm/s) and gradually increase it as you dial in your settings.  Excessive speed can lead to filament buckling and inconsistent extrusion.
    *   **Turn OFF Retraction or Minimize It Greatly:** Retraction can be problematic with flexible filaments.  The filament can compress and bunch up within the extruder. If you must use retraction, keep the distance short (1-2mm) and the speed very low.
    *   **Increase Nozzle Temperature:** NinjaFlex often requires slightly higher printing temperatures than rigid filaments. Experiment within the recommended range (225-235°C) to find the sweet spot for your printer and environment.
    *   **Heated Bed and Adhesion:** A heated bed is almost essential for NinjaFlex. Apply an adhesive such as glue stick, hairspray, or painter's tape to the bed to improve adhesion. A raft or brim can also be helpful, especially for parts with small footprints.
    *   **Nozzle Size:** Try using a larger nozzle (0.6 mm). This can improve layer adhesion and printing speeds.
    *   **Fan Control:** Experiment with fan settings. Some find that turning the cooling fan off or reducing its speed helps improve layer adhesion.
*   **Software Settings:**
    *   **Travel Moves:** Minimize travel moves, especially over open spaces.  These movements can cause stringing or oozing.
    *   **Layer Height:** Use a layer height that is appropriate for your nozzle size and the level of detail you require. A layer height of 0.2mm is a good starting point.
    *   **Infill:** Adjust your infill density to achieve the desired level of flexibility and strength. Lower infill percentages will result in more flexible parts.
*   **Filament Handling:**
    *   **Moisture Sensitivity:**  NinjaFlex is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. This can lead to printing problems like bubbling, stringing, and poor layer adhesion. Store the filament in a dry environment (e.g., a sealed container with desiccant) when not in use. Consider drying the filament before printing if you suspect it has absorbed moisture.
*   **Leveling is Key:**
    *   Your bed needs to be level. This is more important than when printing with PLA or ABS.

## NinjaFlex Filament: Detailed Ratings

Here's a detailed assessment of NinjaFlex, rated out of 10 based on key performance aspects:

*   **Print Quality:** 7/10 - Can produce excellent results with proper tuning, but requires more effort than rigid filaments.  Fine details can sometimes be challenging.
*   **Toughness:** 9/10 - Exceptionally durable and resistant to tearing, abrasion, and impact.
*   **Flexibility:** 10/10 - One of the most flexible 3D printing filaments available. Offers excellent elongation and compression capabilities.
*   **Warping:** 2/10 - Minimal warping due to its low shrinkage rate, especially when using a heated bed.
*   **Adhesion:** 6/10 - Adhesion can be tricky, requiring a heated bed and adhesive solutions. The difficulty comes from dialing in the ideal settings.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 3/10 - Very prone to absorbing moisture, requiring proper storage and potentially drying before use.
*   **Color Range:** 7/10 - Available in a decent range of colors, including translucent options.
*   **Temperature Range:** 7/10 - Requires higher temperatures than PLA and lower than ABS. Dialing in is required.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 8/10 - Generally low odor compared to ABS, but still, ensure adequate ventilation.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 9/10 - Usually well-wound to prevent tangling, but always inspect the spool before printing.

**Average Score: 7.1/10**

## Conclusion: Is NinjaFlex Right for You?

NinjaTek NinjaFlex opens doors to a new realm of 3D printing possibilities. Its exceptional flexibility and durability make it an excellent choice for creating functional and wearable parts. However, it's important to acknowledge the learning curve and the need for careful printer setup and tuning. If you're willing to invest the time and effort, NinjaFlex can be a game-changer for your 3D printing projects.
