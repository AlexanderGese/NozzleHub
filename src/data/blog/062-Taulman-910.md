# Taulman 910: The Unbreakable Filament You Need to Know

Taulman 910, often hailed as "Nylon Alloy 910," is a high-tenacity nylon filament renowned for its exceptional strength, durability, and versatility in the 3D printing world. It's a popular choice for engineers, designers, and hobbyists seeking to create functional prototypes and end-use parts that can withstand demanding environments. Let's dive into the specifics.

## Detailed Specifications

*   **Material:** Nylon Alloy (Proprietary Formulation)
*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm and 2.85mm (check availability)
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 245°C - 255°C (Adjust based on printer and part geometry)
*   **Bed Temperature:** 45°C - 60°C (Often requires a heated bed)
*   **Nozzle:** Hardened steel recommended (due to abrasive nature over time, though brass works)
*   **Print Speed:** 30-60 mm/s (Adjust for optimal layer adhesion and detail)
*   **Density:** 1.12 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** ~8,100 PSI (pounds per square inch) - Varies slightly based on print parameters.
*   **Elongation at Break:** ~75% (Indicates ductility - ability to stretch before breaking)
*   **Glass Transition Temperature:** ~85°C
*   **HDT (Heat Deflection Temperature):** ~120°C at 66 PSI (Important for parts exposed to heat)
*   **Shrinkage Rate:** Relatively low for nylon, but still present (plan for it in design)
*   **Chemical Resistance:** Excellent resistance to fuels, oils, and many solvents. (Refer to official Taulman data for specific chemicals.)
*   **Spool Sizes:** Typically available in 1 lb (0.45 kg) spools.
*   **Color:** Natural (Translucent White), often dye-able.  Colors like black, grey, and safety orange are available, though selection may vary.

## Usage Tips for Taulman 910

Mastering Taulman 910 requires attention to detail. Here are key strategies for success:

1.  **Drying is Essential:** Nylon is notoriously hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air.  *Always* dry your filament before printing, and ideally keep it dry during printing (more on that below).  Use a filament dryer or an oven at a low temperature (40-50°C) for several hours.  You'll know it's dry when it stops hissing/bubbling during printing.

2.  **Dry Box/Environment:** Consider printing directly from a dry box, or enclosing your printer with desiccant to minimize moisture absorption. This is particularly crucial for long prints.

3.  **Bed Adhesion is Critical:**

    *   **Adhesion Methods:** Garolite or FR4, PEI (Polyetherimide) sheet, and certain specialized adhesives (e.g., Magigoo PA) work well.
    *   **First Layer:**  A slow and slightly squished first layer is crucial. Ensure proper bed leveling.
    *   **Brims/Rafts:** Use a brim or raft to increase the contact area with the bed and improve adhesion, especially for larger parts.

4.  **Enclosure Recommended:** An enclosure helps maintain a consistent temperature around the print, reducing warping and improving layer adhesion.

5.  **Print Speed Considerations:**  While you can push it to 60 mm/s, slowing down to 30-40 mm/s often yields better results, particularly for intricate details and overhangs.

6.  **Layer Fan:** Use a *very* low fan speed or turn it off completely, particularly for the first few layers.  The goal is to maintain heat to minimize warping.

7.  **Nozzle Choice:**  While brass nozzles will work in a pinch, hardened steel nozzles are recommended for long-term use, as nylon filaments can be slightly abrasive.

8.  **Design for Nylon:**

    *   **Rounded Corners:** Avoid sharp corners, as these are stress concentration points that can lead to cracking.
    *   **Wall Thickness:** Use sufficient wall thickness to ensure strength.
    *   **Infill:** Experiment with infill patterns and densities to balance strength and weight.  A higher infill percentage generally increases part strength.
    *   **Consider Hole Orientation:** Orient parts so that holes are printed vertically, rather than horizontally, to minimize the need for supports and improve hole accuracy.

9.  **Post-Processing (Annealing):** For maximum strength and heat resistance, consider annealing your parts after printing.  Place the printed part in an oven at a temperature slightly below the glass transition temperature (around 80°C) for 1-2 hours, then allow it to cool slowly inside the oven.  This can increase crystallinity and reduce internal stresses.

10. **Dyeing:** Taulman 910 in its natural state is translucent white. It is very amenable to dyeing with fabric dyes. Follow dye instructions carefully, and consider testing a small piece first.

## Filament Performance Scores (Out of 10)

*   **Print Quality:** 8 - Can produce highly detailed parts with proper settings, though requires careful calibration.
*   **Toughness:** 10 - One of the strongest filaments available.
*   **Flexibility:** 6 - Possesses some flexibility, but primarily known for its strength and rigidity.
*   **Warping:** 5 - Moderate warping tendency, requires excellent bed adhesion and ideally an enclosure.
*   **Adhesion:** 6 - Can be challenging, requires specific bed materials and techniques.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 3 - *Extremely* sensitive to moisture; drying is absolutely critical.
*   **Color Range:** 4 - Primarily available in natural (translucent white) and black, though can be dyed.  Other colors are less common.
*   **Temperature Range:** 9 - High printing and operating temperatures; excellent heat resistance.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 6 - Produces a noticeable odor during printing, ventilation is recommended.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 9 - Generally excellent, minimizing tangles and printing interruptions.

**Average Score:** 6.6/10 - Weighted heavily by the moisture sensitivity, but excels in strength and heat resistance.

Taulman 910 offers exceptional performance for demanding applications. By understanding its properties and employing the right printing techniques, you can unlock its full potential and create robust, durable parts.
