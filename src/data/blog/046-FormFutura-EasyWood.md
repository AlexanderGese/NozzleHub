## FormFutura EasyWood: Bringing the Natural Look to Your 3D Prints

FormFutura EasyWood is a unique 3D printing filament that allows you to create objects with a natural wood-like appearance and texture. This specialized filament opens up a world of possibilities for decorative pieces, architectural models, and functional items that desire a rustic aesthetic. This article will explore the details of EasyWood, covering its specifications, providing tips for successful printing, and evaluating its overall performance.

### What is FormFutura EasyWood?

EasyWood is a PLA-based composite filament infused with finely ground wood particles. This combination gives the printed object a tactile feel and visual characteristics remarkably similar to real wood. Post-processing, such as sanding and staining, further enhances the wood-like qualities, allowing for custom finishes and a genuinely unique look.

### Key Specifications:

*   **Material:** PLA (Polylactic Acid) based composite with wood fibers.
*   **Diameter:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm.
*   **Recommended Nozzle Temperature:** 200-225°C (392-437°F). *Always refer to the specific EasyWood variation you purchase as recommendations can vary slightly.*
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 50-60°C (122-140°F) *Optional. Can often print successfully on a cold bed with good adhesion strategies.*
*   **Density:** Approximately 1.25 g/cm³
*   **Colors Available:** Varied, mimicking different types of wood like Birch, Coconut, Ebony, Olive, Pine, Willow.
*   **Spool Size:** Typically available in 500g and 2.3kg spools.

### Printing with FormFutura EasyWood: Tips for Success

Printing with EasyWood requires a bit of finesse, as the inclusion of wood particles introduces certain considerations. Here are some tips to maximize your success:

1.  **Nozzle Choice:** A larger nozzle (0.4mm or larger) is highly recommended. Wood particles can occasionally cause clogs in smaller nozzles. A hardened steel nozzle is preferable to a brass nozzle due to the abrasive nature of the wood particles, which can wear down a brass nozzle over time.
2.  **Temperature Control:** Start within the recommended temperature range (200-225°C) and fine-tune based on your printer and environment. Higher temperatures can result in darker prints, while lower temperatures may lead to poor layer adhesion. Experimentation is key.
3.  **Print Speed:** Reduce your print speed compared to standard PLA. A slower print speed (40-60 mm/s) allows the filament to melt and bond properly, reducing the risk of clogging and improving layer adhesion.
4.  **Retraction Settings:** Adjust your retraction settings carefully. Excessive retraction can pull wood particles back into the hot end, increasing the likelihood of clogs. Reduce retraction distance and speed if needed.
5.  **Bed Adhesion:** Ensuring good bed adhesion is crucial. Use a heated bed (50-60°C) with a surface like blue painter's tape, PEI, or glass with a glue stick. A brim can also help prevent warping.
6.  **Cooling:** Moderate cooling fan usage is generally recommended. Excessive cooling can lead to layer separation, especially with intricate designs.
7.  **Storage:** EasyWood, like other PLA-based filaments, is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store it in a sealed bag or container with desiccant packs to prevent moisture absorption, which can cause printing issues.
8.  **Post-Processing:** EasyWood is exceptionally well-suited for post-processing. Sanding, staining, and varnishing can dramatically enhance the wood-like appearance and feel.

### Considerations when using Easywood

*   **Clogging:** Keep an eye out for clogging and clear the nozzle regularly.
*   **Layer Adhesion:** Fine tune your settings to avoid separation of the layers.
*   **Brittleness:** Even though the base material is PLA the wood fiber can make it more prone to bending and snapping
*   **Abrasion:** The wood fiber is abrasive and wear out your nozzle overtime.
*   **Darker Prints:** If temp too high it will result in darker prints.

### Performance Score:

Here is a performance evaluation of FormFutura EasyWood based on the listed criteria, all out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 8 - Good detail reproduction, but can vary slightly depending on the chosen wood type and print settings.
*   **Toughness:** 6 - Less impact-resistant than standard PLA, prone to snapping under pressure.
*   **Flexibility:** 3 - Very little flexibility, quite rigid.
*   **Warping:** 7 - Generally less prone to warping than ABS, but can still occur with large prints or inadequate bed adhesion.
*   **Adhesion:** 8 - Adheres well to most common print surfaces with proper preparation.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6 - More susceptible to moisture absorption than standard PLA, requiring careful storage.
*   **Color Range:** 7 - Good range of natural wood tones.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8 - Relatively forgiving, but precise temperature control yields better results.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9 - Minimal odor, similar to standard PLA, less potentially harmful fumes than ABS.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8 - Generally well-wound, but occasional tangles can occur.

**Average Score:** 7.0

### Conclusion:

FormFutura EasyWood is an excellent choice for 3D printing projects where a natural wood-like appearance is desired. While it requires careful attention to printing parameters and post-processing, the results can be truly stunning. Its unique aesthetic makes it a valuable addition to any 3D printing enthusiast's arsenal.
