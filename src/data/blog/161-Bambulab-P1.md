## Bambu Lab P1 Series: Speed Meets Reliability in Mid-Range 3D Printing

The Bambu Lab P1 series, consisting of the **P1P** and **P1S**, brings the powerful high-speed CoreXY printing experience of the Bambu X1 into a more affordable, modular design. Whether you're a maker, prototyper, or just need a workhorse printer, the P1 lineup offers impressive performance out of the box with room to grow.

### üì¶ What Are the P1P and P1S?

The **P1P** is the base model: a high-speed, open-frame CoreXY printer with automatic calibration, multi-material compatibility (via AMS), and top-tier print quality. The **P1S** builds on this with an **enclosed chassis**, additional cooling, and improved safety features‚Äîmaking it better for printing higher-temp materials like ABS or ASA.

## üåü Key Features

### üîÑ CoreXY Motion System
Both printers feature a **CoreXY** architecture that enables **fast and precise movement**, minimizing ghosting even at high speeds.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic Calibration
* Auto bed leveling  
* Vibration compensation  
* Flow calibration  
* Z-offset tuning  

All without user intervention‚Äîready to print within minutes.

### üé® Multi-Material Support with AMS
Both models support the **AMS (Automatic Material System)**, enabling **multi-color and multi-material printing**.

### üõ† Modularity & Upgradeability
Especially on the **P1P**, users can 3D print and attach their own side panels or internal components, while the **P1S** is better for heat-sensitive materials.

### üå° Enclosure Benefits (P1S only)
* Prints ABS, ASA, and other high-temp materials with less warping  
* HEPA + carbon filter for improved air quality  
* Controlled internal environment for more stable results

## üí° Tips for Best Results

* **Enable Vibration Compensation:** Critical for smooth finishes at high speeds.
* **Dry Your Filament:** Especially for PETG, TPU, and PA. Use a dry box or filament dryer.
* **Use the Right Profiles:** Bambu Studio has optimized profiles; tweaking beyond them is optional but can boost quality.
* **Install Filters (P1S):** Replace HEPA filters periodically to maintain air quality.
* **Print Side Panels (P1P):** You can design your own or use community files to enclose the P1P for better thermal stability.

## üßΩ Maintenance Checklist

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Clean build plate (IPA wipe) | Every 3‚Äì5 prints |
| Inspect belts & pulleys | Monthly |
| Update firmware | As released |
| Cold-pull nozzle cleaning | Every 1‚Äì2 weeks or if clogging |
| AMS filament path check | Occasionally (for jams) |
| Lubricate rods and bearings | Every few months |

## üî¨ P1P vs P1S: Which One to Choose?

| Feature | **P1P** | **P1S** |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Enclosure | ‚ùå Open | ‚úÖ Enclosed |
| HEPA Filter | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Better for ABS/ASA | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Price | ‚úÖ Lower | ‚ùå Higher |
| Modifiability | ‚úÖ High | ‚ùå Lower |
| Noise Level | ‚ùå Higher | ‚úÖ Lower |

Choose the **P1P** if you want to **mod and tinker** or primarily print PLA/PETG. Choose the **P1S** if you need **high-temp material compatibility** and value a more enclosed, refined system.
