# Ultimaker 2+ Connect: A Deep Dive into a Reliable Workhorse

The Ultimaker 2+ Connect has carved a niche for itself as a dependable and user-friendly 3D printer, particularly suited for educational institutions, small businesses, and makers who prioritize ease of use and consistent results. Let's delve into what makes this printer tick, explore its capabilities, and provide some practical tips for getting the most out of it.

## Unboxing and Setup: Simplicity at its Core

One of the strongest selling points of the Ultimaker 2+ Connect is its straightforward setup.  The packaging is thoughtfully designed, ensuring the printer arrives safely.  The printer itself comes largely pre-assembled, minimizing the barrier to entry.  After unboxing, you'll essentially need to connect the power cable, load the filament, and perform a simple bed leveling procedure. Ultimaker's clear instructions (both physical and digital) guide you through each step, making the process painless even for beginners.

*   **Dimensions:** 342 x 462 x 580 mm (13.5 x 18.2 x 22.8 inches)
*   **Weight:** 11.5 kg (25.4 lbs)

## Diving Deeper: Features and Functionality

The Ultimaker 2+ Connect builds upon the reliability of its predecessor, the Ultimaker 2+, while adding enhanced connectivity features.

*   **Network Connectivity:** The "Connect" in its name highlights its robust network capabilities.  Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections allow for seamless remote monitoring, print queue management, and firmware updates directly through the Ultimaker Digital Factory platform.  This is particularly useful in environments where multiple users need to access the printer.

*   **Heated Bed:** The heated glass bed is crucial for printing with a wider range of materials, minimizing warping and ensuring good adhesion.  It heats up quickly and maintains consistent temperature throughout the print.

*   **Open Filament System:** Unlike some closed-ecosystem printers, the Ultimaker 2+ Connect allows you to use any compatible 2.85mm filament. This gives you flexibility in choosing the best material for your specific project and often results in cost savings.

*   **Swappable Nozzles:**  The ability to easily swap nozzles opens up different possibilities for print speed, detail, and material compatibility. A smaller nozzle (0.25mm) allows for highly detailed prints, while a larger nozzle (0.8mm) can significantly reduce print times for larger objects.

*   **Ultimaker Cura Integration:** Cura is a powerful and user-friendly slicing software that is tightly integrated with the Ultimaker ecosystem.  It provides pre-configured profiles for various materials and print settings, simplifying the slicing process for beginners.  Experienced users can also customize settings to fine-tune their prints.

*   **Material Station Compatibility:** The Ultimaker Material Station, an optional add-on, provides automated material handling, humidity control, and spool management. This is a significant benefit for those who regularly print with multiple materials or require long, unattended print runs.

## Tips and Tricks for Optimal Performance:

*   **Bed Leveling is Key:**  Proper bed leveling is paramount for good adhesion and print quality. Utilize the built-in bed leveling wizard and ensure the nozzle has the correct gap between it and the bed. Re-level the bed periodically, especially after moving the printer.

*   **Filament Storage:**  Proper filament storage is crucial, especially for moisture-sensitive materials like Nylon and PETG.  Store filaments in airtight containers with desiccant packs to prevent moisture absorption, which can lead to stringing, poor layer adhesion, and nozzle clogging.

*   **Nozzle Maintenance:** Regularly clean the nozzle to prevent clogs. Use a nozzle cleaning tool or perform a cold pull to remove any accumulated debris.

*   **Temperature Calibration:**  Experiment with temperature settings for different filaments.  Slight adjustments to the nozzle and bed temperature can significantly impact print quality and adhesion.

*   **Adhesion Aids:** For difficult-to-adhere materials like ABS, consider using adhesion aids such as glue stick, painter's tape, or a brim/raft in Cura.

*   **Ultimaker Community:**  The Ultimaker community is a valuable resource for troubleshooting, sharing tips, and finding pre-configured print profiles for various materials.
