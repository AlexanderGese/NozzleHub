## Dive Deep into Prusament PLA Azure Blue: A Comprehensive Review

Prusament PLA Azure Blue. The name itself evokes images of clear skies and serene waters. But beyond the evocative moniker, how does this filament perform in the real world of 3D printing? This article aims to provide a detailed and unbiased look at this popular offering from Prusa Research.

### Specifications: A Closer Look

Before we dive into the practical aspects of using Prusament PLA Azure Blue, let's examine its core specifications:

*   **Material:** PLA (Polylactic Acid)
*   **Color:** Azure Blue (a vibrant, slightly turquoise-leaning blue)
*   **Diameter:** Typically 1.75mm (Prusament is known for its tight diameter tolerance)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** +/- 0.02mm (a key factor in print quality)
*   **Spool Weight:** 1kg
*   **Printing Temperature:** 215-230°C (Refer to Prusa's specific recommendation, usually around 215°C)
*   **Bed Temperature:** 55-60°C (Although sometimes you can print on colder beds but with the correct adhesion strategy)
*   **Density:** 1.24 g/cm³
*   **Recommended Printing Speed:** 40-60 mm/s (adjust based on your printer and model)
*   **Certification:** Prusament is known for its rigorous in-house testing and certifications, guaranteeing quality.

### Usage Tips for Optimal Results

Getting the best results from Prusament PLA Azure Blue requires a bit more than just loading the filament and hitting print. Here are some practical tips:

*   **First Layer Calibration is Key:** PLA, even Prusament, benefits immensely from a well-calibrated first layer. Ensure your nozzle is the correct distance from the bed for good adhesion.
*   **Temperature Tuning:** While Prusa recommends 215°C, your ideal temperature may vary slightly depending on your printer, ambient temperature, and printing speed. Experiment within the specified range to find the sweet spot for your setup. Keep in mind that lower temperatures are less prone to warping and higher temperatures produce better layer adhesion.
*   **Adhesion Strategies:** While a heated bed is recommended, using a good bed adhesive like hairspray, glue stick, or PEI sheet will significantly improve adhesion, especially for larger prints. Clean the print surface properly with isopropyl alcohol to remove any oils or residue.
*   **Cooling is Crucial:** PLA benefits from good cooling. Use your printer's cooling fan effectively to prevent warping and improve overhang performance. Increase the fan speed during bridging sections.
*   **Storage:** Like all PLA filaments, Prusament PLA Azure Blue is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store it in a dry environment (ideally with desiccant) when not in use. If you suspect the filament has absorbed moisture, drying it in a filament dryer or a low-temperature oven (around 45-50°C) for a few hours can improve print quality.
*   **Retraction Settings:** Fine-tune your retraction settings to minimize stringing, especially when printing complex models with gaps.
*   **Bridging:** Experiment with bridging settings such as nozzle temperature, layer height, and cooling to minimize drooping.
*   **Print Speed:** Slower print speeds tend to produce more accurate and cleaner prints compared to faster print speeds.
*   **Infill:** Use enough infill for the prints that will be undergoing load. Use rectilinear infill for more faster prints and gyroid for more sturdy prints.

### Performance Assessment: The Nitty-Gritty

Now, let's evaluate Prusament PLA Azure Blue across key performance categories. Keep in mind that these are subjective assessments based on general user feedback and common experiences:

*   **Print Quality:** 9/10 - Excellent surface finish, sharp details, and consistent layer adhesion. The tight diameter tolerance contributes to exceptional print accuracy.
*   **Toughness:** 7/10 - PLA is generally not known for extreme toughness. However, Prusament PLA exhibits decent impact resistance compared to some cheaper PLA filaments.
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 - PLA is inherently rigid. Do not expect significant flexibility with this filament.
*   **Warping:** 8/10 - Warping is minimal, especially with proper bed adhesion and cooling. Larger prints may still require careful attention.
*   **Adhesion:** 9/10 - Excellent adhesion to a properly prepared bed with or without adhesive.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10 - PLA is sensitive to moisture. Proper storage is crucial.
*   **Color Range:** N/A - Focusing specifically on Azure Blue.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 - For PLA, it performs well in the recommended range.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9/10 - Low odor compared to some other filaments. Almost non-existent.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 10/10 - Prusament is renowned for its impeccable spool winding, minimizing tangles and print failures.

### Overall Score

**Average Score:** 7.8/10
