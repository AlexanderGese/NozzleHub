## MatterHackers PRO Series Nylon: A Deep Dive into Engineering-Grade Filament

Nylon filaments have earned their reputation in the 3D printing world for their exceptional strength, durability, and resistance to wear and tear. The MatterHackers PRO Series Nylon aims to deliver all these benefits, offering users a filament engineered for demanding applications. Let's take a detailed look at what makes this filament tick, how to use it effectively, and what you can expect from it.

**What is MatterHackers PRO Series Nylon?**

The PRO Series Nylon is a professional-grade filament designed to produce parts that require high strength, impact resistance, and resistance to high temperatures. MatterHackers has specifically formulated this filament to offer improved printability compared to some other nylon formulations while maintaining its impressive mechanical properties.

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Material:** Nylon Polyamide (PA)
*   **Diameter:** Typically 1.75mm or 2.85mm (check specific spool)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** +/- 0.05mm (This is important for consistent extrusion)
*   **Recommended Print Temperature:** 240°C - 260°C (This range is a starting point; adjustments may be needed based on your printer and environment)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 80°C - 100°C (Good adhesion is key with nylon, requiring a heated bed)
*   **Print Speed:** 30-60 mm/s (Nylon benefits from moderate speeds for optimal layer adhesion)
*   **Density:** ~1.14 g/cm³
*   **Tensile Strength:** Up to 65 MPa (This represents its resistance to being pulled apart)
*   **Elongation at Break:** Up to 30% (Illustrates its ductility – how much it can stretch before breaking)
*   **Impact Strength:** Up to 150 J/m (Shows its resistance to sudden impacts)
*   **Spool Sizes:** Available in 0.5kg and 1kg spools.
*   **Colors:** Typically available in Natural (translucent white) and Black, but variety may be limited.

**Usage Tips for Success:**

Printing with nylon can be a bit trickier than PLA, but following these tips will drastically improve your results:

1.  **Dry Filament is Crucial:** Nylon is *extremely* hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air. This moisture causes printing issues like stringing, popping, and reduced strength. Always dry your filament before printing and keep it dry during printing.
    *   **Drying Method:** A dedicated filament dryer is best. You can also use a conventional oven at a low temperature (around 70°C or 160°F) for several hours. *Monitor carefully and do not exceed the recommended temperature, as this could damage the filament.*
    *   **Storage:** Use airtight containers with desiccant to store your filament when not in use.

2.  **Enclosure Recommended:** While not strictly *required* in some cases, an enclosure helps maintain a consistent temperature around the print, reducing warping and improving layer adhesion.

3.  **Bed Adhesion is Key:** Nylon is prone to warping due to its high shrinkage rate.
    *   **Bed Surface:** PEI, Garolite (FR4), or a bed coated with a strong adhesive like Magigoo PA or a specialized nylon adhesive are recommended.
    *   **Brim or Raft:** Use a wide brim (5-10mm) or a raft to increase the surface area adhering to the bed.

4.  **Nozzle Choice:** Hardened steel nozzles are recommended if printing frequently with abrasive materials (carbon fiber filled nylon). Standard brass nozzles are acceptable for regular nylon but may wear down over time.

5.  **Print Settings:**
    *   **Layer Height:** Typically, 0.15mm - 0.25mm works well.
    *   **Fan Speed:** Minimal or no cooling fan. Too much cooling can lead to warping and delamination.
    *   **Retraction:** Experiment with retraction settings to minimize stringing.
    *   **Infill:** Choose an appropriate infill pattern and density based on the desired strength and weight of the part.

6.  **First Layer:** Ensure your first layer is properly squished onto the bed. This is crucial for a good foundation.

7.  **Ventilation:** While PRO Series Nylon generally produces less odor than some other nylons, good ventilation is still recommended when printing, especially in enclosed spaces.

**MatterHackers PRO Series Nylon: The Verdict (Out of 10)**

*   **Print Quality:** 7/10 (Can be excellent with dialed-in settings, but requires more effort than PLA)
*   **Toughness:** 9/10 (Excellent impact and tensile strength)
*   **Flexibility:** 6/10 (More rigid than flexible, but exhibits some flexibility before breaking)
*   **Warping:** 5/10 (Prone to warping if precautions aren't taken)
*   **Adhesion:** 6/10 (Requires specific bed surfaces and careful calibration)
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 2/10 (Extremely hygroscopic - a significant drawback)
*   **Color Range:** 3/10 (Limited color options)
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 (Good heat resistance for functional parts)
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 6/10 (Noticeable, but generally less intense than some other nylons. Still requires ventilation)
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8/10 (Generally well-wound, minimizing tangles)

**Average Score: 6/10**

**Conclusion:**

MatterHackers PRO Series Nylon is a capable engineering-grade filament that can produce very strong and durable parts. However, it's important to understand its limitations, particularly its moisture sensitivity and tendency to warp. By carefully controlling your printing environment and following the recommended usage tips, you can unlock the full potential of this filament and create high-performance parts for demanding applications. It's not the easiest filament to work with, and requires a bit of practice, but the results can be well worth the effort for functional prototypes and end-use parts.
