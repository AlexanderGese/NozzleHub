    *   **Software:** Snapmaker Luban (All-in-one software for 3D printing, laser engraving/cutting, and CNC carving)

**Usage Tips for Optimal Performance:**

*   **3D Printing:**
    *   **Leveling:** Bed leveling is crucial for successful prints. Utilize the auto-leveling feature and manually fine-tune if needed. Consider a BLTouch upgrade for enhanced auto-leveling.
    *   **Adhesion:** Use appropriate bed adhesion techniques, such as glue stick, blue painter's tape, or specialized bed adhesives, depending on the material.
    *   **Material Settings:** Research and test optimal temperature, speed, and retraction settings for each filament type. Experimentation is key.
    *   **Enclosure:** For materials like ABS, an enclosure is highly recommended to maintain a consistent temperature and prevent warping. Snapmaker sells an optional enclosure.
*   **Laser Engraving/Cutting:**
    *   **Focusing:** Proper laser focus is critical for clean cuts and engravings. Utilize the focusing tool and adjust the height accordingly.
    *   **Air Assist:** Consider adding an air assist system to improve cut quality and reduce burning, especially with thicker materials.
    *   **Material Testing:** Always test engraving/cutting parameters on a small area of the material before committing to the entire project.
    *   **Safety:** Wear appropriate laser safety glasses at all times. Ensure proper ventilation to remove fumes.
*   **CNC Carving:**
    *   **Workholding:** Securely clamp the workpiece to the bed to prevent movement during carving.
    *   **Tool Selection:** Choose the appropriate tool for the material and desired cut. Use sharp, high-quality bits.
    *   **Feed Rate and Depth of Cut:** Experiment with feed rates and depths of cut to optimize performance and prevent tool breakage.
    *   **Dust Collection:** Use a vacuum system to remove dust and debris.

**Snapmaker Luban Software:**

Snapmaker Luban is the unified software platform for controlling the A350T's various functions. It allows you to:

*   Import and prepare 3D models for printing.
*   Design and import laser engraving/cutting files.
*   Generate CNC toolpaths from 2D and 3D designs.
*   Monitor and control the machine.
*   Update firmware.

While Luban is convenient, some users may find it limiting compared to dedicated software like Cura (for 3D printing) or LightBurn (for laser engraving). However, it's a good starting point and provides a streamlined workflow for beginners.

**Pros:**

*   **Versatility:** 3D printing, laser engraving/cutting, and CNC carving in one machine.
*   **Large Build Volume:** The A350T's build volume is significant, allowing for larger projects.
*   **Ease of Assembly:** Relatively easy to assemble with clear instructions.
*   **Modular Design:** Allows for future upgrades and expansions.
