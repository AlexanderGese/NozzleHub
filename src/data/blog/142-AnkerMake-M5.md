## Getting Started: A User's Guide

Setting up the AnkerMake M5 is relatively straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Assembly:** Attach the gantry to the base, then mount the filament holder. The assembly process is designed to be quick and easy.

2.  **Leveling:** The M5 features automatic bed leveling, which simplifies the initial setup. Run the leveling process through the printer's interface.

3.  **Software Installation:** Download and install the AnkerMake slicer software on your computer or use another slicer.

4.  **Calibration:** Once the machine is assembled run the calibration test, if you would like a more optimized calibration test then it would be advised to download a calibration test from Thingiverse or similar site.

5.  **Slicing:** Prepare your 3D model by slicing it using the AnkerMake software or other preferred software. Choose the appropriate settings for your desired material and print quality.

6.  **Printing:** Load your sliced file onto the printer via USB or Wi-Fi. Preheat the nozzle and bed, and start the print.

### Usage Tips for Optimal Printing

*   **First Layer Adhesion:** Ensure a clean build plate and proper nozzle height for optimal first-layer adhesion. Use glue stick or hairspray if necessary for materials like ABS.

*   **Filament Storage:** Keep your filament dry. Moisture can significantly impact print quality. A dry box is recommended, especially for hygroscopic materials like nylon.

*   **Temperature Settings:** Experiment with temperature settings based on the filament you are using. Different materials have different requirements.

*   **Speed Considerations:** While the M5 boasts high-speed printing, complex models or those requiring fine details may benefit from slower speeds.

*   **Software Updates:** Keep the printer's firmware and software updated for the latest features and bug fixes.

*   **Proper Ventilation:** Ensure adequate ventilation in your printing area, especially when using materials that produce fumes.

*   **Tuning the retraction settings:** Tuning retraction settings can help prevent stringing and improve print quality. It is important to tune retraction settings for any material that is printed.
