## Hatchbox ABS Filament: A Comprehensive Review

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a widely used thermoplastic known for its toughness, heat resistance, and impact resistance. Hatchbox ABS is a popular choice among 3D printing enthusiasts for its consistent quality and relatively easy printing characteristics. This article delves into the specifics of Hatchbox ABS, offering a comprehensive overview, usage tips, and an objective evaluation.

**What is Hatchbox ABS?**

Hatchbox ABS is a thermoplastic filament specifically formulated for use in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers. It is known for its strong inter-layer adhesion when printed correctly, resulting in durable and functional parts. Hatchbox is a well-established brand, consistently praised for its quality control and affordability.

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Diameter:** Typically 1.75mm or 3.0mm (verify the specification on the specific product you buy)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** ±0.03mm (this tight tolerance contributes to print consistency)
*   **Printing Temperature:** 210-250°C (depending on your printer and environment)
*   **Bed Temperature:** 80-110°C (crucial for adhesion and warp prevention)
*   **Density:** ~1.04 g/cm³ (affects print weight and material usage calculations)
*   **Tensile Strength:** ~42 MPa (indicates the material's resistance to pulling forces)
*   **Impact Strength:** ~15 kJ/m² (measure of its ability to withstand sudden impacts)
*   **Available Colors:** Varies widely, including Black, White, Gray, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and many more.
*   **Spool Size:** Typically 1 kg (2.2 lbs)

**Usage Tips for Optimal Printing:**

Printing with ABS can be a bit more challenging than using PLA, but following these tips will dramatically improve your results:

1.  **Enclosure is Essential:** An enclosure maintains a consistent ambient temperature around the print, minimizing warping and cracking. This is perhaps the most crucial factor for successful ABS prints. A cardboard box can even work in a pinch for testing.

2.  **Heated Bed is a Must:** Adhesion is key. A bed temperature in the 80-110°C range is recommended. Use a bed adhesive like glue stick, hairspray, or specialized ABS slurry to further enhance adhesion.

3.  **First Layer Matters:** Slow down the first layer speed to ensure proper adhesion. A well-leveled bed is also absolutely essential.

4.  **Avoid Drafts:** Even with an enclosure, drafts can negatively impact ABS prints. Make sure your printer is located in a stable environment away from open windows or air conditioning vents.

5.  **Optimize Cooling:** While ABS needs less cooling than PLA, you may still need some. Start with minimal fan settings (10-20%) and adjust as needed to prevent stringing or bridging issues.

6.  **Print Speed:** Moderate print speeds (40-60 mm/s) generally yield the best results with Hatchbox ABS. Too fast, and you risk poor layer adhesion. Too slow, and you risk heat creep and nozzle clogging.

7.  **Proper Storage:** ABS is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Store your filament in a sealed container with desiccant packs to prevent moisture absorption, which can lead to printing issues like bubbling and stringing.

8.  **Ventilation:** ABS emits fumes when heated. Ensure your printing area is well-ventilated to avoid inhaling these fumes. A dedicated air purifier can also be beneficial.

9.  **Dealing with Warping:** If warping persists, try increasing the bed temperature slightly, using a raft or brim, or adjusting the print orientation to minimize the footprint on the bed.

10. **Experiment:** Every printer is different. Don’t be afraid to experiment with settings like temperature, speed, and retraction to find what works best for your setup.

**Hatchbox ABS Evaluation:**

Here's a breakdown of Hatchbox ABS based on key performance indicators, rated out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 (Consistent and smooth prints achievable with proper settings)
*   **Toughness:** 9/10 (ABS is known for its strength and impact resistance)
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 (ABS is a rigid material; low flexibility)
*   **Warping:** 6/10 (Can be managed with proper techniques but requires attention)
*   **Adhesion:** 7/10 (Good adhesion achievable with heated bed and adhesive)
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10 (Requires proper storage to prevent issues)
*   **Color Range:** 8/10 (Wide variety of colors available)
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 (Suitable for applications requiring moderate heat resistance)
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 5/10 (Noticeable odor; ventilation recommended)
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 9/10 (Typically well-wound, minimizing tangles)

**Average Score: 7.2/10**
