# The 3D Systems ProJet 1200: A Deep Dive into Desktop Micro-SLA 3D Printing

The 3D Systems ProJet 1200 occupies a unique niche in the 3D printing landscape. It’s a compact, professional-grade micro-SLA (Stereolithography) printer designed for creating incredibly detailed, small-scale parts. Unlike FDM printers that melt and extrude plastic filament, the ProJet 1200 uses liquid resin and a UV projector to cure layers, resulting in significantly higher resolution and smoother surfaces. This makes it ideal for applications like jewelry design, dental modeling, and microfluidics prototyping. Let's delve into the specifics of this intriguing machine.

## Understanding the ProJet 1200 Workflow

The ProJet 1200 workflow involves several key steps, from initial model preparation to final part finishing:

1.  **Model Preparation:** The process starts with a 3D model, typically designed in CAD software. This model needs to be converted to an STL file format, compatible with the ProJet 1200's software. The orientation of the model within the build volume is crucial for optimal printing. Minimize support structures where possible to save resin and reduce post-processing effort.

2.  **Slicing and Support Generation:** The 3D Systems Quickparts software is used to slice the STL file into thin layers and generate necessary support structures. These supports are crucial for anchoring the part during the printing process and preventing warping or collapse, particularly for overhanging features. The software provides options for adjusting support density and placement.

3.  **Resin Loading:** The ProJet 1200 utilizes a cartridge-based resin system. To load the resin, simply insert a fresh cartridge into the designated slot. The printer automatically manages the resin level during the printing process.

4.  **Printing:** Once the model is prepared and the resin loaded, the printing process can begin. The printer uses a UV projector to selectively cure each layer of resin, building the part from the bottom up. The print time depends on the complexity and size of the model.

5.  **Post-Processing:** After the printing is complete, the part needs to be removed from the build platform. This requires carefully detaching the support structures using specialized tools. The part then needs to be cleaned to remove any uncured resin. This is typically done by submerging the part in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and gently scrubbing it with a soft brush.

6.  **UV Curing:** To ensure the part is fully cured and achieves its optimal mechanical properties, it is recommended to place it in a UV curing chamber for a specified amount of time. This final curing step strengthens the resin and enhances its durability.

## Usage Tips for Optimal Results

*   **Resin Selection:** Choosing the right resin is critical. Each VisiJet FTX resin has different properties (e.g., stiffness, clarity, castability). Select the resin that best suits the intended application.
*   **Orientation Matters:** Optimize the model's orientation within the build volume. This affects support structure placement, surface finish, and print time. Experiment with different orientations to find the best configuration.
*   **Support Structure Optimization:** Minimize support structures by carefully considering overhangs and angles. Excessive supports consume more resin and increase post-processing time.
*   **Cleaning and Curing:** Thoroughly clean the printed parts with IPA to remove any uncured resin. Ensure proper ventilation during the cleaning process. Always follow the recommended UV curing time for the specific resin being used.
*   **Build Plate Preparation:** Ensure the build plate is clean and level before starting a print. A clean surface promotes good adhesion.
*   **Software Familiarity:** Take the time to learn the intricacies of the Quickparts software. Understanding its features and settings allows for precise control over the printing process.
*   **Maintenance:** Regularly clean the resin tank and projector lens. Dust and debris can negatively impact print quality.
*   **Temperature Control:** Maintaining a stable operating temperature within the recommended range is crucial for consistent results.

## ProJet 1200 Performance Evaluation

Here’s an evaluation of the ProJet 1200 based on key performance categories, each rated out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 9/10. The ProJet 1200 excels in print quality, producing extremely detailed parts with smooth surfaces, superior to FDM-printed counterparts.
*   **Build Volume:** 4/10. The small build volume is a limitation, restricting the size of printable objects. It's ideal for small, intricate items only.
*   **Printing Speed:** 6/10. Printing speed is moderate. More complex prints can take several hours.
*   **Material Compatibility:** 5/10. Limited to 3D Systems' VisiJet FTX resins. This restricts material choices compared to printers with open material systems.
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 8/10. Bed adhesion is generally reliable, minimizing print failures. The build platform requires only occasional leveling.
*   **Reliability:** 7/10. With proper maintenance, the ProJet 1200 is relatively reliable. However, resin spills and contamination can sometimes occur.
*   **Ease of Use:** 6/10. The Quickparts software is straightforward, but the overall SLA workflow (resin handling, post-processing) requires more skill and attention than FDM printing.
*   **Firmware and Software:** 7/10. The Quickparts software is functional, providing essential slicing and support generation tools, but lacks advanced features found in other slicers.
*   **Connectivity Options:** 3/10. Only USB connectivity. Lack of network or wireless options is a drawback.
*   **Build Quality & Durability:** 7/10. The ProJet 1200 has a solid build. Proper care extends its lifespan.
*   **Noise Level:** 8/10. Relatively quiet during operation, especially compared to FDM printers.
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** 5/10. Requires regular cleaning of the resin tank and optics. The proprietary resin system adds complexity.
*   **Customer Support:** 6/10. Customer support is available from 3D Systems, but responsiveness can vary.
*   **Upgradeability:** 2/10. Limited upgradeability options. The ProJet 1200 is primarily a closed system.
*   **Price to Performance Ratio:** 6/10. The initial cost is relatively high for its limited build volume. However, the exceptional print quality justifies the price for specific applications.

**Average Score:** 6.07/10

## Conclusion

The 3D Systems ProJet 1200 stands out as a highly specialized tool. Its exceptional print quality makes it ideal for creating small, detailed parts. While its small build volume and limited material compatibility may not suit all users, its strengths in resolution and surface finish are undeniable.
