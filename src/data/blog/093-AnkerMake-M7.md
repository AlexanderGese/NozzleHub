**Getting Started: Unboxing and Setup**

The AnkerMake M7 arrives well-packaged and requires minimal assembly. Expect the following in the box:

*   AnkerMake M7 3D Printer
*   Print bed
*   Spool holder
*   Power cord
*   USB drive with documentation and software
*   Basic tool kit (wrenches, nozzles, filament snips, etc.)
*   Sample filament

The initial setup involves:

1.  Attaching the spool holder.
2.  Connecting the power cord.
3.  Powering on the printer.
4.  Following the on-screen prompts to complete the initial configuration, including Wi-Fi setup.
5.  Performing the automatic bed leveling process.
6.  Loading filament.

**Usage Tips and Best Practices**

To maximize the AnkerMake M7's performance and print quality, consider the following:

*   **Bed Adhesion is Key:** While the M7 boasts automatic bed leveling, ensuring a clean and level print bed is crucial. Clean the bed regularly with isopropyl alcohol. Consider using a bed adhesive (glue stick, hairspray) for materials prone to warping.
*   **Filament Management:** Store filament in a dry environment to prevent moisture absorption. If filament has been exposed to moisture, consider drying it before use.
*   **Slicer Settings:** Experiment with slicer settings to optimize print quality and speed. Pay close attention to layer height, infill density, print speed, and temperature settings. The AnkerMake Slicer, based on Cura, provides a good starting point.
*   **Temperature Control:** Ensure the nozzle and bed temperatures are appropriate for the chosen filament. Refer to the filament manufacturer's recommendations. For ABS and ASA, consider printing in an enclosure to minimize warping.
*   **Camera Monitoring:** Utilize the integrated camera to monitor prints remotely and detect potential issues. The AI-powered error detection can alert you to problems like spaghetti-ing before they become major catastrophes.
*   **Regular Maintenance:** Keep the printer clean and lubricated. Periodically check and tighten belts and screws. Clean the nozzle and replace it as needed.
*   **Firmware Updates:** Stay up-to-date with the latest firmware releases to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.
