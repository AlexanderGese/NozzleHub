*   **High-Speed Printing:** Thanks to the ACF release film and optimized firmware, the Mars 4 Ultra can reach impressive printing speeds of up to 150 mm/h. This significantly reduces print times compared to older models and competitors.
*   **Air Purifier:** The integrated activated carbon filter helps to minimize resin odors during printing, making it a more pleasant experience, especially in enclosed spaces.
*   **Dual Linear Rails:** The dual linear rails on the Z-axis ensure stable and precise movement, contributing to consistent print quality and reducing the risk of layer shifting.
*   **Linux Operating System:** This enables seamless connectivity, improved processing power, and allows for future software updates and features.

### Usage Tips for Optimal Results

To get the most out of your Elegoo Mars 4 Ultra, consider these tips:

*   **Level the Build Plate Carefully:** Even though the printer offers semi-automatic leveling, double-check the level using the paper method to ensure proper adhesion.
*   **Choose the Right Resin:** Experiment with different resin brands and formulations to find what works best for your specific needs. Factors to consider include print detail, strength, color, and curing time.
*   **Optimize Slicing Settings:** Spend time learning how to adjust slicing settings in CHITUBOX or Lychee Slicer. Key parameters to consider include layer height, exposure time, lift speed, and support settings.
*   **Support Placement is Crucial:**  Strategically placed supports are essential for successful resin printing. Use auto supports as a starting point, but always manually adjust them to ensure adequate support for overhangs and intricate details. Consider using different support types (light, medium, heavy) depending on the area of the model.
*   **Clean the Build Plate and Resin Tank Regularly:**  Keep the build plate and resin tank clean to prevent adhesion issues and ensure consistent print quality. Use isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to clean the build plate and a soft spatula to remove any cured resin from the FEP film.
*   **Monitor the Printing Process:**  Keep an eye on the first few layers to ensure proper adhesion. If you notice any issues, stop the print and troubleshoot the problem before wasting resin.
*   **Post-Processing is Essential:**  Resin prints require post-processing, including washing in IPA and curing under UV light. Follow the resin manufacturer's recommendations for optimal results.
*   **Wear Protective Gear:** Always wear gloves and a mask when handling resin to protect yourself from skin irritation and harmful fumes.
