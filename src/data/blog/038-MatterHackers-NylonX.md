# Unveiling the Strength: A Deep Dive into MatterHackers NylonX Filament

Nylon filaments are known for their impressive strength, durability, and abrasion resistance. MatterHackers NylonX takes these inherent qualities and elevates them with the addition of chopped carbon fiber, resulting in a truly exceptional material for demanding 3D printing applications. Let's explore the ins and outs of this high-performance filament.

## What is MatterHackers NylonX?

MatterHackers NylonX is a blend of polyamide (Nylon) and short carbon fibers. The carbon fiber reinforcement significantly enhances the filament's strength, stiffness, and dimensional stability compared to standard nylon. This makes it ideal for creating parts that need to withstand high stress, wear, and elevated temperatures. Think functional prototypes, jigs and fixtures, end-use parts, and even RC car components.

## Key Specifications:

*   **Material:** Nylon Polyamide with Chopped Carbon Fiber
*   **Diameter:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm
*   **Spool Weight:** Usually 0.5kg or 1kg
*   **Color:** Typically black or dark grey due to the carbon fiber content.
*   **Nozzle Temperature:** 250°C - 275°C (482°F - 527°F)
*   **Bed Temperature:** 70°C - 80°C (158°F - 176°F)
*   **Recommended Print Speed:** 30-50 mm/s (adjust based on printer and part geometry)
*   **Heated Bed Required:** Yes
*   **Enclosure Recommended:** Highly recommended for larger parts
*   **Nozzle Recommendation:** Hardened steel nozzle is highly recommended due to the abrasive nature of carbon fiber.
*   **Tensile Strength:** Significantly higher than standard nylon. Consult the MatterHackers datasheet for specific values.
*   **Elongation at Break:** Lower than standard nylon due to the carbon fiber, resulting in increased stiffness.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** HIGH. Nylon is hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air.

## Tips for Successful Printing with NylonX:

Printing with NylonX can be challenging, but following these tips will significantly improve your results:

1.  **Drying is Crucial:** NylonX is extremely hygroscopic. Before printing, dry your filament thoroughly using a filament dryer or an oven at a low temperature (around 60°C) for several hours. A dry box is also essential for storing the filament during printing to minimize moisture absorption.

2.  **Use a Hardened Steel Nozzle:** The carbon fiber in NylonX is abrasive and will quickly wear down standard brass nozzles. Invest in a hardened steel nozzle to avoid clogs and ensure consistent extrusion.

3.  **Optimize Bed Adhesion:** Good bed adhesion is critical to prevent warping. Use a heated bed set to the recommended temperature (70-80°C). Adhesion aids such as PEI sheets, glue stick, or specialized nylon adhesives can be beneficial.

4.  **Enclosure is Your Friend:** An enclosure helps maintain a consistent ambient temperature around the print, reducing the risk of warping and delamination. This is especially important for larger parts.

5.  **Fine-Tune Your Settings:** Experiment with print speed, layer height, and extrusion multiplier to find the optimal settings for your printer. Slower speeds often improve adhesion and reduce the risk of warping.

6.  **Proper Cooling:** While an enclosure is important to maintain ambient temp, use minimal cooling, excessive cooling can lead to warping

7.  **First Layer Settings are Important:** Make sure your first layer is thick enough and not too fast of a print speed and with the bed temp set accordingly.

## NylonX Strengths

*   **High Strength and Stiffness:** The carbon fiber reinforcement significantly enhances the material's mechanical properties.
*   **Excellent Abrasion Resistance:** Ideal for parts that will be subjected to wear and friction.
*   **Improved Dimensional Stability:** Reduced warping and shrinkage compared to standard nylon.
*   **Heat Resistance:** Can withstand higher temperatures than many other 3D printing materials.
*   **Functional Parts:** Great for creating durable end-use parts and functional prototypes.

## NylonX Weaknesses

*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** Requires careful drying and storage to prevent printing issues.
*   **Abrasive:** Requires a hardened steel nozzle to prevent wear.
*   **Printing Difficulty:** Can be more challenging to print than materials like PLA or PETG.
*   **Limited Color Options:** Typically available in black or dark grey.
*   **Odor During Printing:** Nylon can produce some fumes during printing, so good ventilation is recommended.

## NylonX Rating

Here's my rating of MatterHackers NylonX filament, based on the criteria outlined:

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 - Can achieve excellent results with proper settings and moisture control, but requires more tweaking than simpler materials.
*   **Toughness:** 10/10 - One of the strongest filaments available.
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 - Significantly less flexible than standard nylon due to the carbon fiber. More rigid.
*   **Warping:** 5/10 - Warping can be an issue, especially with larger parts, but can be mitigated with proper bed adhesion and an enclosure.
*   **Adhesion:** 7/10 - Good adhesion can be achieved with a heated bed and proper bed preparation.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 2/10 - Extremely hygroscopic, requiring careful drying and storage.
*   **Color Range:** 1/10 - Typically limited to black or dark grey.
*   **Temperature Range:** 9/10 - High heat resistance makes it suitable for demanding applications.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 4/10 - Can produce noticeable fumes during printing, so good ventilation is recommended.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8/10 - MatterHackers generally provides well-wound spools.

**Average Score:** (8+10+3+5+7+2+1+9+4+8) / 10 = **5.7/10**

**Conclusion:**

MatterHackers NylonX is a powerful filament that unlocks the potential for creating exceptionally strong, durable, and heat-resistant parts. While it presents some challenges due to its moisture sensitivity and the need for specific hardware (hardened nozzle) and settings, the resulting prints offer unparalleled performance in demanding applications. If you need parts that can withstand high stress, wear, and elevated temperatures, NylonX is a worthwhile investment.
