## ProtoPasta Matte Fiber HTPLA: A Comprehensive Guide for 3D Printing Enthusiasts

ProtoPasta's Matte Fiber HTPLA has carved out a significant niche in the 3D printing filament market. This composite filament blends the ease of PLA with enhanced properties, offering a unique surface finish and improved heat resistance. Let's dive deep into its specifications, usage tips, and overall performance.

### What is Matte Fiber HTPLA?

Matte Fiber HTPLA is a High-Temperature Polylactic Acid (HTPLA) infused with a cellulose fiber component. This clever combination results in a filament that's easier to print than ABS, while boasting a matte finish that hides layer lines and reduces the shiny appearance often associated with PLA. The addition of cellulose fibers also improves the filament's rigidity and heat resistance compared to standard PLA.

### Detailed Specifications:

*   **Material Composition:** HTPLA (High-Temperature Polylactic Acid) with Cellulose Fiber
*   **Diameter Options:** Typically available in 1.75mm and 2.85mm (confirm availability with your supplier)
*   **Spool Size:** Common spool sizes are 500g and 1kg
*   **Recommended Nozzle Temperature:** 195°C - 235°C (adjust based on your printer and printing speed)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 50°C - 60°C (optional; adhesion is often good without a heated bed)
*   **Print Speed:** 40-60mm/s (adjust based on your printer and part complexity)
*   **Bed Adhesion:** Excellent on clean glass, PEI, or BuildTak surfaces. Using a brim or raft can further improve adhesion for larger parts.
*   **Post-Processing:** Sands well, paints easily, and accepts adhesives.
*   **Heat Treatment:** HTPLA can be heat-treated for enhanced heat resistance.  Bake at 110°C (230°F) for 1-2 hours after printing for maximum heat resistance. Let the part cool down slowly inside the oven.
*   **Color Range:** ProtoPasta offers a variety of colors in their Matte Fiber HTPLA line, including natural (uncolored), grey, black, and specialized options like Rustable Magnetic Iron PLA.

### Usage Tips for Optimal Results:

*   **Storage:** Like all PLA-based filaments, Matte Fiber HTPLA is hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air). Store in an airtight container with desiccant when not in use to prevent printing issues.
*   **Drying:** If you suspect your filament has absorbed moisture (signs include popping or hissing during printing, stringing, or poor layer adhesion), dry it in a filament dryer or oven at a low temperature (around 45-50°C) for several hours before printing.
*   **Nozzle Choice:** A hardened steel nozzle is recommended, especially if printing with abrasive variants like the Rustable Magnetic Iron PLA. The cellulose fibers can cause wear on brass nozzles over time.
*   **Print Settings:**
    *   **Layer Height:** Use a layer height that's between 25% and 75% of your nozzle diameter.
    *   **Cooling:** Moderate cooling is generally recommended. Avoid excessive cooling, as it can lead to warping.
    *   **Retraction:** Fine-tune your retraction settings to minimize stringing. A slightly higher retraction speed and distance may be needed compared to standard PLA.
*   **Heat Treating:** If you need higher heat resistance, use a convection oven and set it at 110°C. Make sure to use a non-stick surface like a silicone mat to prevent the part from sticking to the surface. Let the oven cool down completely with the part inside to avoid warping.

### Filament Performance Ratings (Out of 10):

*   **Print Quality:** 8 - Excellent surface finish and hides layer lines well.
*   **Toughness:** 7 - Better than standard PLA, but not as strong as ABS or PETG.
*   **Flexibility:** 3 - Relatively rigid, not suitable for flexible parts.
*   **Warping:** 9 - Very low warping tendency, especially with a heated bed.
*   **Adhesion:** 9 - Excellent adhesion to various build surfaces.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6 - Moderate; requires proper storage to prevent moisture absorption.
*   **Color Range:** 7 - Decent range, including unique specialty options.
*   **Temperature Range:** 7 - Higher than standard PLA due to HTPLA base.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9 - Minimal odor, similar to standard PLA.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8 - Generally good winding, minimizing tangles.

**Average Score:** 7.2
