# Polymaker PolyLite ABS: A Deep Dive into This Workhorse Filament

Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, or ABS, is a stalwart of the 3D printing world. Known for its strength, heat resistance, and affordability, it's a popular choice for functional parts and durable prototypes. Today, we're taking a close look at Polymaker's PolyLite ABS, a readily available and widely respected option in the ABS filament market.

## What is PolyLite ABS?

PolyLite ABS is Polymaker's offering in the standard ABS category. It aims to deliver a good balance of printability and desirable ABS properties at a competitive price point. This makes it a good entry point into the world of ABS printing for those familiar with easier materials like PLA.

## Key Specifications:

Here's a breakdown of the essential specifications for PolyLite ABS:

*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm & 2.85mm (check availability with your supplier)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** +/- 0.05mm (Generally consistent, contributing to reliable prints)
*   **Print Temperature:** 230-260°C (446-500°F) – A heated enclosure is HIGHLY recommended.
*   **Bed Temperature:** 80-100°C (176-212°F) – Crucial for adhesion and warping prevention.
*   **Printing Speed:** 30-60mm/s (Adjust based on printer capabilities and part complexity)
*   **Density:** 1.04 g/cm³
*   **Glass Transition Temperature:** ~105°C (221°F) – Indicative of its higher temperature resistance compared to PLA.
*   **Spool Weight:** Typically 1kg (2.2 lbs)
*   **Colors Available:** A decent selection of colors is generally available, including black, white, grey, red, blue, and other common shades. Check with your vendor for current stock.

## Usage Tips and Best Practices for PolyLite ABS:

Printing with ABS can be more challenging than printing with PLA. Here's how to get the most out of PolyLite ABS:

*   **Enclosure is Key:** An enclosure is *highly* recommended. This helps maintain a consistent ambient temperature, minimizing warping and layer separation. If you don't have a dedicated enclosure, a makeshift cardboard box can sometimes help, but be mindful of printer safety.
*   **Heated Bed is a Must:** A heated bed is absolutely essential for ABS printing. Dial in the bed temperature to the recommended range (80-100°C) and experiment to find what works best for your printer and build surface.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** Proper bed adhesion is crucial. Consider using:
    *   **ABS Slurry:** Dissolve ABS filament in acetone to create a slurry. Apply a thin layer to the build plate before printing.
    *   **Glue Stick:** A layer of glue stick (purple disappearing glue works well) can improve adhesion.
    *   **Kapton Tape or PEI:** These build surfaces often provide good adhesion for ABS.
*   **Draft Shield:** Utilize a draft shield in your slicer software. This is a single-layer perimeter printed around the object, helping to isolate it from drafts and temperature fluctuations.
*   **Cooling Fan:** Limit cooling fan usage. While PLA benefits from cooling, ABS is prone to warping if cooled too rapidly.
*   **First Layer:** The first layer is paramount. Slow down the first layer speed and ensure good bed leveling for optimal adhesion.
*   **Ventilation:** ABS emits fumes during printing. Ensure you have adequate ventilation in your printing area.
*   **Drying:** ABS is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. If you suspect your filament is wet, dry it before printing. A filament dryer is ideal, but an oven on a low setting (check Polymaker's drying recommendations) can also work.
*   **Experiment with Settings:** Every printer is different. Don't be afraid to experiment with temperature, speed, and retraction settings to find what works best for your setup.

## PolyLite ABS: Rating Breakdown (Out of 10)

Let's break down PolyLite ABS's performance across various criteria:

*   **Print Quality:** 7/10 - Can produce good quality prints with dialed-in settings, but requires more fine-tuning than PLA. Layer adhesion can be an issue if not careful.
*   **Toughness:** 8/10 - Demonstrates good impact resistance and durability, suitable for functional parts.
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 - ABS is generally rigid and lacks significant flexibility. Not suitable for applications requiring bending.
*   **Warping:** 6/10 - Warping can be a problem, particularly with larger prints or without an enclosure. Requires careful attention to bed adhesion and temperature control.
*   **Adhesion:** 6/10 - Layer adhesion and bed adhesion require proactive measures to ensure successful prints.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 7/10 - ABS is hygroscopic and needs to be dried if not stored properly.
*   **Color Range:** 7/10 - Polymaker offers a decent selection of colors, covering common needs.
*   **Temperature Range:** 7/10 - Requires higher temperatures than PLA, necessitating a printer capable of reaching and maintaining these temperatures.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 4/10 - ABS produces a noticeable odor and fumes during printing. Adequate ventilation is essential.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 9/10 - Polymaker is known for good spool winding, minimizing tangles and print failures.

**Average Score: 6.7/10**

## Conclusion

PolyLite ABS is a solid choice for those looking to print functional parts with the benefits of ABS. While it requires more careful tuning and precautions than PLA, the improved strength and temperature resistance can make it worth the effort. By following the usage tips and best practices outlined above, you can achieve high-quality prints with this workhorse filament. Remember to prioritize proper bed adhesion, enclosure use, and adequate ventilation for optimal results.
