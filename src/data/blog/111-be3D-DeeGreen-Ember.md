# Deep Dive: be3D DeeGreen Ember - The PLA Filament You Need To Know

If you're diving into the world of 3D printing, you're quickly going to realize that the filament you choose can make or break your projects.  PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a popular choice for beginners and experienced users alike due to its ease of use and eco-friendliness. Today, we're taking a closer look at be3D DeeGreen Ember, a PLA filament that's been making waves in the community. Is it just another PLA, or does it stand out from the crowd? Let's find out.

## What is be3D DeeGreen Ember?

DeeGreen Ember is a PLA filament produced by be3D. PLA, as mentioned, is a bioplastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane.  Ember is marketed as being user-friendly, providing good print quality, and being suitable for a wide range of 3D printers. But marketing speak aside, what's the real deal?

## Detailed Specifications

Here's a breakdown of the core specs of the DeeGreen Ember filament:

*   **Material:** PLA (Polylactic Acid)
*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm (This is the standard diameter for most consumer-grade 3D printers)
*   **Spool Weight:** Typically available in 1kg spools (this is a common standard)
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 200-220°C (This is a good starting point, but may require tweaking based on your printer and environment)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 50-60°C (Heated bed recommended, but some users have success without depending on the print)
*   **Tensile Strength:** (Varies depending on the formulation of the PLA, consult the manufacturer's datasheet for specific values)
*   **Impact Strength:** (Again, consult the datasheet for specific values)
*   **Density:** (Typically around 1.24 g/cm³)
*   **Available Colors:** (This varies.  Check with your vendor for the most up-to-date color options.)
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** +/- 0.05mm (Good diameter tolerance is crucial for consistent extrusion)

## Usage Tips for Optimal Results

Getting the most out of DeeGreen Ember requires a little bit of finesse. Here are some tips to ensure your prints come out looking their best:

*   **Temperature Tuning:**  The recommended temperature range (200-220°C) is just a guideline.  Start in the middle (210°C) and print a temperature tower to find the sweet spot for your printer.  If you're seeing stringing, lower the temperature. If the layers aren't adhering well, increase the temperature.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** PLA is generally good with bed adhesion, but a clean and level bed is crucial.  Use isopropyl alcohol to clean the bed before each print.  A thin layer of glue stick or hairspray can also help, especially for larger prints.
*   **Cooling Fan:** PLA benefits from good cooling.  Make sure your cooling fan is running at 100% after the first few layers. This helps prevent warping and improves surface quality.
*   **Print Speed:**  Start with a moderate print speed (around 50-60mm/s).  You can increase it later if you're confident in your printer's capabilities and the filament's performance.
*   **First Layer:**  A well-tuned first layer is the foundation of a good print.  Make sure your nozzle is properly calibrated and the bed is leveled.  Adjust the Z-offset if necessary to ensure the first layer is properly squished onto the bed.
*   **Storage:** PLA is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. This can lead to brittle prints and poor layer adhesion. Store your DeeGreen Ember filament in an airtight container with desiccant packs to keep it dry.  If you suspect your filament has absorbed moisture, consider drying it in a filament dryer before printing.

## DeeGreen Ember: A Filament Scorecard

Let's evaluate DeeGreen Ember across key filament characteristics, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best:

*   **Print Quality:** 8/10 (Produces clean prints with good detail, especially when dialed in.)
*   **Toughness:** 6/10 (Standard PLA toughness; suitable for many applications, but not for high-stress parts.)
*   **Flexibility:** 3/10 (PLA is generally not flexible.  Don't expect this filament to bend much.)
*   **Warping:** 7/10 (PLA is less prone to warping than ABS, and Ember performs well in this regard with proper cooling.)
*   **Adhesion:** 8/10 (Excellent bed adhesion with a heated bed and proper preparation.)
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6/10 (PLA is hygroscopic; requires proper storage to prevent issues.)
*   **Color Range:** 7/10 (Generally offers a decent range of colors, but may vary by vendor.)
*   **Temperature Range:** 8/10 (The recommended range of 200-220°C is standard and easily achievable on most printers.)
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9/10 (PLA has a minimal odor compared to other filaments; generally considered safe to print indoors with ventilation.)
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8/10 (Typically well-wound to prevent tangles during printing.)

**Average Score: 7.0/10**

## Conclusion: Is DeeGreen Ember Right for You?

DeeGreen Ember is a solid PLA filament that delivers good print quality, reliable performance, and a user-friendly experience. While it's not the strongest or most flexible filament, it's a great choice for general-purpose 3D printing projects, especially for beginners. Its ease of use and relatively low odor make it a good option for printing at home or in the office. Just remember to store it properly to prevent moisture absorption and dial in your settings for optimal results.
