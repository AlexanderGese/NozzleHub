### Usage Tips and Best Practices

Getting the most out of your Ultimaker S3 requires understanding its strengths and quirks. Here are some tips to ensure successful prints:

*   **Bed Leveling:** The S3 features automatic bed leveling. Always run the bed leveling calibration procedure after moving the printer or if you suspect leveling issues. Ensure the nozzle is clean before calibration.
*   **Print Core Selection:** Choose the appropriate print core for your material. Use the AA cores for standard materials like PLA and ABS. The BB core is designed for water-soluble support material (PVA). For abrasive materials, invest in CC print cores.
*   **Adhesion is Key:** Clean the glass build plate with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) before each print. For materials like ABS, consider using a thin layer of glue stick for better adhesion. Brim and raft settings in Cura can also improve adhesion.
*   **Material Storage:** Keep your filaments in a dry environment. Moisture can significantly affect print quality, especially for materials like Nylon and PVA. Use airtight containers with desiccant packets.
*   **Temperature Settings:** Experiment with temperature settings within the recommended ranges for your chosen filament. Slight adjustments can often improve layer adhesion, reduce warping, and enhance overall print quality.
*   **Print Speed Optimization:** While the S3 can print relatively fast, slower speeds often yield better results, particularly for complex geometries or materials prone to warping.
*   **Support Material Strategy:** When using support material, experiment with support settings in Cura to find the optimal balance between support strength and ease of removal. The "Support Interface" option can create a smoother interface between the support and the part, making removal easier.
*   **Firmware Updates:** Keep your printer's firmware up-to-date. Ultimaker regularly releases firmware updates with bug fixes and performance improvements.
*   **Maintenance:** Regularly clean the print cores, check the PTFE couplers for wear, and lubricate the axes to keep your printer running smoothly.
*   **Cura Settings:** Familiarize yourself with Cura's advanced settings. Experiment with features like "Retraction," "Combing Mode," and "Outer Wall Wipe Distance" to fine-tune your print quality.
