## Usage Tips and Tricks

Getting the most out of your FLSUN QQ-S Pro requires a bit of understanding and some experimentation. Here are some essential tips to optimize your printing experience:

*   **Calibration is Key:** While the QQ-S Pro boasts automatic bed leveling, it's crucial to calibrate the Z-offset properly. A slightly too-high or too-low nozzle can dramatically impact adhesion and the quality of your first layer. Pay close attention during the initial calibration process and fine-tune as needed.
*   **Filament Drying:** Like many 3D printers, the QQ-S Pro is susceptible to filament issues caused by moisture absorption. Especially with hygroscopic materials like PETG and TPU, consider drying your filament before printing. A dedicated filament dryer or even a low-temperature oven can make a significant difference.
*   **Print Speed Experimentation:** Delta printers are known for their potential speed. While the QQ-S Pro can handle high speeds, pushing it too far without proper tuning can lead to quality issues. Start with moderate speeds and gradually increase them while monitoring for vibrations, ringing, and layer adhesion problems.
*   **Adhesion Solutions:** Bed adhesion is vital. For PLA, a clean glass bed often suffices. For more challenging materials like ABS or PETG, consider using adhesion aids like glue stick, hairspray, or specialized adhesive sheets.
*   **Firmware Updates:** FLSUN occasionally releases firmware updates that address bugs, improve performance, and add new features. Regularly check the FLSUN website or online communities for updates and follow the instructions carefully for installation.
*   **Support Structures:** Delta printers generally require careful consideration of support structures, especially for models with overhangs or complex geometries. Experiment with different support settings in your slicing software to find the optimal balance between support strength and ease of removal.
*   **Cooling Fan Adjustments:** Adjusting the cooling fan speed can significantly impact the appearance and strength of your prints. Experiment with different fan settings based on the material you are using. PLA generally benefits from more cooling, while ABS and PETG may require less to prevent warping.
*   **First Layer is Key:** The first layer is the foundation of the entire print. Ensure the bed is properly leveled and the nozzle is at the correct height. A slow first layer speed and a slightly higher temperature can improve adhesion.
*   **Optimize Retraction:** Delta printers, due to their long Bowden tubes, often require optimized retraction settings to prevent stringing. Experiment with retraction distance and speed to find the sweet spot for your chosen filament.

## Detailed Scoring (Out of 10)

Here's a detailed breakdown of the FLSUN QQ-S Pro based on key performance categories:

*   **Print Quality:** 7/10 (Capable of good prints with proper tuning; slight ringing can occur at high speeds)
*   **Build Volume:** 8/10 (Good usable space for most projects)
*   **Printing Speed:** 8/10 (Potentially fast, but requires fine-tuning to avoid quality issues)
*   **Material Compatibility:** 7/10 (Handles PLA, PETG, and TPU well; ABS requires an enclosure for consistent results)
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 7/10 (Auto-leveling is helpful, but initial Z-offset calibration is crucial)
*   **Reliability:** 7/10 (Generally reliable, but occasional maintenance may be required)
*   **Ease of Use:** 8/10 (Touchscreen interface and pre-assembled design make it relatively user-friendly)
*   **Firmware and Software:** 6/10 (Stock firmware is functional, but custom firmware may offer more advanced features. Standard slicers are compatible)
*   **Connectivity Options:** 6/10 (MicroSD and USB are adequate but lacking Wi-Fi connectivity)
*   **Build Quality & Durability:** 7/10 (Aluminum frame provides decent stability, but acrylic panels can be prone to scratching)
*   **Noise Level:** 6/10 (Noticeable fan noise during operation)
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** 6/10 (Regular cleaning and lubrication are necessary)
*   **Customer Support:** 5/10 (Community support is generally more helpful than official FLSUN support)
*   **Upgradeability:** 7/10 (Various upgrades are available, such as hotends, extruders, and cooling solutions)
*   **Price to Performance Ratio:** 8/10 (Offers good value for its price point)

**Average Score:** 6.93/10
