## NinjaTek Cheetah: A Deep Dive into this High-Performance TPU Filament

NinjaTek Cheetah is a widely recognized and respected TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) filament known for its impressive blend of speed, strength, and flexibility. It’s a go-to material for engineers, hobbyists, and designers who need parts that can withstand demanding environments and offer a degree of resilience that rigid filaments can’t provide. Let's delve into the details of this popular flexible filament.

### Detailed Specifications:

*   **Material:** Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)
*   **Shore Hardness:** 95A (Relatively hard for a TPU, but still significantly flexible)
*   **Tensile Strength:** ~41 MPa
*   **Elongation at Break:** ~480%
*   **Diameter Tolerance:** +/- 0.05 mm (Generally considered excellent, ensuring consistent extrusion)
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 230-240°C
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 40-50°C (Though some users report success without a heated bed)
*   **Printing Speed:** Up to 60mm/s (Significantly faster than many other flexible filaments)
*   **Nozzle Size:** 0.4mm recommended, but larger sizes can be used.
*   **Density:** 1.12 g/cm³
*   **Spool Size:** Available in various sizes (e.g., 0.5kg, 1kg)
*   **Color Range:** Broad, with options ranging from vibrant solids to translucent colors.

### Usage Tips for Optimal Printing:

Printing with flexible filaments like NinjaTek Cheetah can be a bit different than printing with PLA or ABS. Here are some tips to ensure successful prints:

*   **Direct Drive Extruder:** Ideally, use a printer with a direct drive extruder. This minimizes the distance the filament travels between the drive gear and the hot end, reducing the risk of buckling or wrapping. If you have a Bowden setup, consider shortening the Bowden tube or using a tighter filament guide.
*   **Slow Down:** While Cheetah is faster than other flexible filaments, it's still crucial to start with a moderate printing speed. A good starting point is around 30-40 mm/s, and you can increase it gradually.
*   **Reduce Retraction:** Excessive retraction can cause the filament to stretch and get stuck in the extruder. Minimize retraction distance (ideally less than 2mm) and speed. Consider disabling retraction altogether for certain prints.
*   **Turn off part cooling:** Part cooling can lead to delamination so keeping the part hot will help
*   **Adjust Flow Rate:** Sometimes, slightly increasing the flow rate (by 5-10%) can help prevent under-extrusion.
*   **Bed Adhesion:** Clean your build plate thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol. If needed, use a thin layer of glue stick or hairspray to improve adhesion, especially for larger prints.
*   **Support Structures:** Design your parts to minimize the need for supports. If supports are necessary, use a low support density and a relatively large Z gap to make them easier to remove.
*   **Storage:** Like other filaments, Cheetah is susceptible to moisture absorption. Store it in an airtight container with desiccant when not in use. If you suspect your filament has absorbed moisture, dry it in a filament dryer before printing.
*   **Firmware Settings:** Ensure your printer's firmware has linear advance and pressure advance enabled for best results.

### NinjaTek Cheetah: A Filament Evaluation (Out of 10):

*   **Print Quality:** 8 - Can achieve excellent detail with proper tuning. Layer adhesion is generally very good.
*   **Toughness:** 9 - Very durable and impact-resistant.
*   **Flexibility:** 7 - Good flexibility, but stiffer than some other TPUs (like NinjaFlex).
*   **Warping:** 9 - Minimal warping due to the lower printing temperature and inherent flexibility.
*   **Adhesion:** 8 - Excellent adhesion to a properly prepared build plate.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 6 - Moderately susceptible to moisture absorption. Proper storage is essential.
*   **Color Range:** 8 - Wide range of colors available.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8 - Reasonable range, offers some wiggle room to avoid stringing.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 9 - Low odor compared to ABS or some other filaments.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8 - Generally well-wound spools.

**Average Score:** 8.0
