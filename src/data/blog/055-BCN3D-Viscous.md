## Diving Deep into BCN3D Viscous: A Technical Look at This Unique Filament

BCN3D Viscous is a specialty filament designed for achieving unique textures and patterns in your 3D prints. It's not your typical PLA or ABS; it offers a specific aesthetic and functional purpose. Let's break down what makes this filament tick, how to use it effectively, and how it stacks up against other options.

**What is BCN3D Viscous?**

BCN3D Viscous is a proprietary filament formulation that leverages a unique viscosity characteristic to create textured surfaces and patterned fills. Unlike conventional filaments, it doesn't aim for perfect smoothness. Instead, it intentionally exploits controlled variations in flow and adhesion during the printing process. This results in a tactile and visually interesting surface finish, often mimicking the look of woven materials or natural textures.

**Detailed Specifications:**

*   **Material Composition:** BCN3D does not release the exact chemical composition, claiming proprietary reasons. However, it is likely a modified thermoplastic polymer blend. It is known to contain an additive that influences its viscosity and adhesion properties.

*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm (typical)

*   **Spool Size:** Generally available in 750g spools.

*   **Printing Temperature:** 210-230°C (BCN3D recommends 220°C)

*   **Bed Temperature:** 50-60°C (BCN3D recommends 60°C)

*   **Printing Speed:** Generally slower speeds are recommended, typically between 30-50 mm/s.

*   **Layer Height:**  0.15mm to 0.25mm recommended for optimal texture definition.

*   **Density:** Approximately 1.25 g/cm³

*   **Tensile Strength:** Relatively low compared to general-purpose filaments. Expect lower mechanical properties.

*   **Elongation at Break:** Low, indicating limited flexibility.

*   **Heat Deflection Temperature:** Low; not suitable for high-temperature applications.

**Usage Tips for Optimal Results:**

*   **Slow and Steady Wins the Race:** The key to success with BCN3D Viscous is controlling the printing speed.  Reducing the speed allows the filament to properly adhere and create the desired texture. Start slow and experiment with increasing speed slightly until you find the sweet spot for your printer.

*   **Temperature Control is Crucial:**  Fine-tuning the temperature is essential. Too high, and the texture will be muted; too low, and you risk adhesion issues. Incrementally adjust the temperature in small steps (5°C at a time) until you achieve the desired effect.

*   **First Layer Adhesion is Paramount:** Ensure a perfectly level bed and proper first layer adhesion.  A brim or raft is highly recommended to prevent warping and ensure the print stays firmly planted to the build plate.

*   **Retraction Settings:**  Minimize retraction to reduce stringing and maintain consistent flow. Experiment with retraction distance and speed. Often, disabling retraction entirely (or using very minimal retraction) yields the best results.

*   **Optimize Layer Height:** A slightly thicker layer height (within the recommended range) can enhance the texture.

*   **Nozzle Size Matters:** Nozzles larger than 0.4mm can help accentuate the texture.

*   **Experiment with Infill Patterns:** Try different infill patterns to influence the overall texture.  Gyroid or concentric patterns can yield interesting results.

*   **Dry Filament is Essential:**  Like many filaments, BCN3D Viscous can be susceptible to moisture. Store it in a dry environment and consider using a filament dryer before printing.

*   **Part Orientation:** Consider the print orientation to maximize the effect of the texture. Vertical surfaces will typically exhibit the most pronounced texture.

**Filament Performance Ratings (Out of 10):**

*   **Print Quality:** 7 - Offers unique textured finishes; not for smooth, high-precision prints.
*   **Toughness:** 4 - Lower strength than standard filaments. Not ideal for functional parts.
*   **Flexibility:** 2 - Very brittle. Not suitable for flexible applications.
*   **Warping:** 6 - Prone to warping if bed adhesion is not perfect.
*   **Adhesion:** 7 - Requires careful calibration of temperature and bed adhesion.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 7 - Moderately sensitive to moisture; requires dry storage.
*   **Color Range:** 5 - Limited color options compared to standard filaments.
*   **Temperature Range:** 6 - Narrow temperature window for optimal printing.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 8 - Relatively low odor and fume production.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 8 - Generally well-wound, minimizing tangles.

**Average Score: 6.0**

**Conclusion:**

BCN3D Viscous is not an all-purpose filament. It is a specialty material for users seeking to achieve unique textures and visual effects in their 3D prints. Understanding its limitations and employing the recommended printing techniques is crucial for success. While its mechanical properties are lower than standard filaments, its unique surface finish makes it a compelling option for artistic and decorative applications.
