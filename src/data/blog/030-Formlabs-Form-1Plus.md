# The Formlabs Form 1+: A Deep Dive into Resin-Based Precision

The Formlabs Form 1+ might be a name from the past in the rapidly evolving world of 3D printing, but it still holds a significant place in the history of desktop stereolithography (SLA). This article delves into the Form 1+, exploring its specifications, offering practical usage tips, and evaluating its strengths and weaknesses. Forget comparisons; we're focusing solely on the machine itself.

## Understanding the Form 1+

The Form 1+ represented a significant step forward in accessible resin printing. Prior to its release, SLA technology was primarily confined to industrial settings. The Form 1+ aimed to bring high-resolution printing to a wider audience of designers, engineers, and hobbyists. It operates using a process called stereolithography (SLA), where a liquid resin is selectively cured by a laser beam. This allows for the creation of highly detailed and accurate parts.

## Key Specifications: The Devil's in the Details

*   **Technology:** Stereolithography (SLA)
*   **Build Volume:** 125 x 125 x 165 mm (4.9 x 4.9 x 6.5 inches)
*   **Layer Resolution:** 25, 50, and 100 microns (0.001, 0.002, and 0.004 inches)
*   **Laser Spot Size:** Approximately 140 microns
*   **Resin Compatibility:** Formlabs Standard Resins (Clear, White, Grey, Black, Tough, Flexible) - other resins may work but are not officially supported
*   **Connectivity:** USB
*   **Software:** PreForm (Formlabs' proprietary software)
*   **Dimensions:** 300 x 280 x 450 mm (11.8 x 11 x 17.7 inches)
*   **Weight:** Approximately 8 kg (17.6 lbs)
*   **Power Requirements:** 100-240V, 50/60 Hz

## Getting the Most Out of Your Form 1+: Usage Tips

The Form 1+ can be a powerful tool, but mastering it requires understanding its quirks and limitations. Here's some essential advice:

*   **Resin Handling is Critical:** Resin is light-sensitive. Always store it in a dark, opaque container when not in use. Exposure to ambient light can thicken or even cure the resin, leading to printing failures. Wear gloves and eye protection when handling resin.
*   **PreForm Software is Your Friend:**  Learn PreForm inside and out.  It's crucial for orienting your parts for optimal printing, generating supports, and slicing the model. Experiment with different support densities and configurations to minimize scarring and maximize print success.
*   **Orientation Matters:**  Orient your parts strategically to minimize support structures and maximize print quality. Overhanging features often require heavy support, which can be difficult to remove and leave blemishes.  Angle your parts to minimize the "suction cup effect" â€“ trapping resin between layers which can cause delamination.
*   **Support Removal Techniques:**  Proper support removal is vital to preserving the quality of your print. Start by carefully snipping away larger supports with flush cutters. For finer supports, consider using a hobby knife or even a deburring tool. Be patient and avoid applying excessive force, which can damage the print.
*   **Post-Curing is Essential:** After printing, you'll need to rinse your print in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to remove excess resin. Then, post-cure the print under UV light to fully harden the resin and achieve its final mechanical properties. The duration of post-curing depends on the resin type and desired properties. A dedicated UV curing chamber is highly recommended.
*   **Regular Maintenance is Key:** The Form 1+ requires regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance. Clean the resin tank after each print, especially if you've had a failure. Inspect the build platform for debris or damage. Periodically check the laser window for smudges or dust and clean it carefully with a lint-free cloth and isopropyl alcohol.
*   **Leveling is Paramount:** Ensure the build platform is properly leveled before each print. Even a slight misalignment can lead to print failures or adhesion issues. The Form 1+ uses a manual leveling system.
*   **Troubleshooting: A Systematic Approach:** If you encounter a print failure, don't panic. Start by carefully examining the failed print. Note where the failure occurred, the shape of the failed section, and any other relevant details. Consult the Formlabs documentation or online forums for potential causes and solutions. Common issues include insufficient support, incorrect resin settings, or a dirty laser window.

## Strengths and Weaknesses of the Form 1+

**Strengths:**

*   **High Resolution and Detail:** The SLA technology allows for exceptionally detailed prints with fine features and smooth surfaces.
*   **Smooth Surface Finish:** Prints have a significantly smoother surface finish compared to FDM-printed parts, reducing the need for post-processing.
*   **Versatile Material Options (Within Formlabs Ecosystem):** Formlabs offers a range of resins with varying properties, including standard, tough, and flexible options, allowing for a wide range of applications.
*   **Relatively Compact Footprint:** Compared to industrial SLA machines, the Form 1+ has a relatively small footprint, making it suitable for desktop use.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Limited Build Volume:** The relatively small build volume can be restrictive for larger prints.
*   **Resin Handling:** Resin printing requires careful handling and post-processing, which can be messy and time-consuming.
*   **Resin Costs:** Formlabs resins can be relatively expensive compared to FDM filaments.
*   **Maintenance Requirements:** The Form 1+ requires regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance.
*   **Potential for Mess and Fumes:** Resin can be messy, and some resins may emit fumes, so proper ventilation is essential.
*   **Complexity compared to FDM:** Setting up and troubleshooting the Form 1+ can be more complex than FDM printers.
*   **reliance on Formlabs resins** While others work it might ruin the printer.

## Form 1+ Score Breakdown

Here's an evaluation of the Form 1+ across various categories, scored out of 10:

*   **Print Quality:** 9/10 (Excellent detail and surface finish)
*   **Build Volume:** 5/10 (Relatively small)
*   **Printing Speed:** 6/10 (Moderate speed, SLA inherently slower than FDM)
*   **Material Compatibility:** 7/10 (Limited to Formlabs resins primarily, but decent variety within)
*   **Bed Adhesion & Leveling:** 7/10 (Requires careful leveling, but good adhesion once calibrated)
*   **Reliability:** 7/10 (Can be reliable with proper maintenance and careful usage)
*   **Ease of Use:** 6/10 (More complex than FDM, requires careful setup and post-processing)
