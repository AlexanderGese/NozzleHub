## Diving Deep into Prusament ASA Jet Black: A Comprehensive Review

ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) is quickly becoming a go-to filament for engineers and hobbyists alike who need parts that can withstand the elements. Prusament's ASA Jet Black aims to provide that durability with the quality and consistency Prusament is known for. Let's take a closer look.

### Detailed Specifications

*   **Material:** ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate)
*   **Color:** Jet Black (RAL 9005)
*   **Diameter:** 1.75mm +/- 0.02mm (Prusament's tight tolerance)
*   **Spool Weight:** Typically 1kg (net weight of filament)
*   **Recommended Printing Temperature:** 240-260°C (464-500°F)
*   **Recommended Bed Temperature:** 90-110°C (194-230°F)
*   **Recommended Enclosure:** Highly recommended for best results.
*   **Shrinkage:** Relatively low compared to ABS.
*   **UV Resistance:** Excellent
*   **Chemical Resistance:** Good
*   **Density:** ~1.07 g/cm³

### Usage Tips and Best Practices

Printing with ASA requires a bit more attention than PLA, but the results are worth it. Here's how to get the most out of Prusament ASA Jet Black:

*   **Enclosure is Key:** Seriously, use an enclosure. ASA is prone to warping as it cools, and an enclosure helps maintain a consistent temperature around the print. This dramatically reduces warping and layer separation.

*   **Bed Adhesion:** A heated bed is essential. Clean your bed thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol before each print. Consider using a brim to further improve adhesion, especially for large or complex parts. PEI sheets or other bed surfaces designed for high-temperature filaments work best.

*   **Dial in Your Temperature:** Start with the recommended printing temperature of 240-260°C and fine-tune it based on your printer and the specific part you are printing. A temperature tower can be a great tool for this.

*   **Cooling Considerations:** While some cooling is necessary to prevent overhangs from drooping, excessive cooling can exacerbate warping. Try to keep the cooling fan speed relatively low (20-40%) or even off for the first few layers.

*   **Print Speed:** Slower print speeds generally lead to better layer adhesion and reduce the risk of warping. Start with a speed of around 40-50 mm/s and adjust as needed.

*   **Ventilation:** ASA emits fumes during printing, although less pungent than ABS. Ensure adequate ventilation in your printing area. Consider using an air purifier.

*   **Drying:** Like many filaments, ASA can absorb moisture from the air. If you experience stringing, popping, or poor layer adhesion, dry the filament before printing. A dedicated filament dryer is recommended.

*   **Storage:** Store your ASA filament in an airtight container with desiccant when not in use to prevent moisture absorption.

### Filament Review Scores (Out of 10)

*   **Print Quality:** 9 - With proper settings and an enclosure, you can achieve excellent detail and surface finish.
*   **Toughness:** 9 - ASA is known for its high impact resistance and durability.
*   **Flexibility:** 3 - ASA is not a flexible filament. It's designed for rigidity.
*   **Warping:** 6 - While better than ABS, warping is still a concern, especially without an enclosure.
*   **Adhesion:** 8 - Good bed adhesion with proper preparation and temperature settings.
*   **Moisture Sensitivity:** 7 - ASA is relatively sensitive to moisture, requiring careful storage.
*   **Color Range:** 7 - Jet Black is a classic and reliable color, but the overall ASA color range is more limited than PLA.
*   **Temperature Range:** 8 - The higher temperature range allows for stronger parts but requires a printer capable of reaching those temperatures.
*   **Odor & Fumes:** 6 - ASA emits fumes during printing, requiring ventilation.
*   **Spool Winding Quality:** 10 - Prusament is known for excellent spool winding, minimizing tangles.

**Average Score: 7.3**
